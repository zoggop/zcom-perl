On a hot day, chill a peach. Cut it in half. Remove its pit. Slice it thinly. Pour lightly whipped (not stiff) cream over these slices. Is any slice not mealy? Eat it.

Squeeze twenty small lemons. In a large sauce pan, sear some tender meat on both sides and remove quickly to a plate. In the same pan, saut√©e onions and garlic. Once golden brown, deglaze the pan with 1/2 cup of stock. Add lemon juice. Thicken with a tablespoon of flour, and cook down to desired consistency. Plop the meat back into the pan and remove from heat. Salt to taste. Let stand indeterminately.

Grill several chicken legs. Ensure that the grill is very hot. Every five minutes, flip them over, and pour a generous layer of barbecue sauce over each. If excess barbecue sauce does not cause flames to leap from the grill, use olive oil. Keep flipping and lathering until the legs develop a thick, black crust. Meticulously scrape off this crust with a knife.
