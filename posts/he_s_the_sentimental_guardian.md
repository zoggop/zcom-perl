# He's the sentimental guardian

He's the sentimental guardian of an ancient sword. He calls her a witch.  He accuses her of stealing the secrets the keeps, yet only mastering "basic moves." He goes on. "You misunderstood the wudang manual quite a bit." We know better. So does her pupil: "wudang is a whorehouse!" For Jade Fox's part, she's just disappointed her pupil is so taken with a sword that she steals it. "You wouldn't be in this if you hadn't."
