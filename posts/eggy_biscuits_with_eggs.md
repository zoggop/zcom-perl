# Eggy Biscuits with Eggs
## 18 February 2011 6:42 AM

I sometimes use an egg as a trick to make biscuits fluffier. It does render them somewhat unbiscuitlike, but they always seem to come out a little flat if I don’t use an egg. The eggy biscuit is like a bad combover, but maybe nice if one doesn’t want it to be something it’s not.













Eggy Biscuits

1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1 teaspoon salt (if using salted butter, then 3/4 teaspoon salt)
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
6 tablespoons butter
1 egg
~1/2 cup milk

Preheat oven to 450 F. Combine flours, salt, and baking powder in a large mixing bowl. Cut butter into flour with a pastry cutter. Crack egg into measuring cup. Fill measuring cup to 3/4 cup mark with milk. Break up egg with a fork, and then pour egg & milk into mixing bowl. Mix to make a dry dough. Form dough into a ball with your hands, and knead it about ten times. Roll dough into a small sheet 1/3 inch thick. Cut with a bowl about 3 inches across, or more appropriate implement. Bake on a sheet until golden brown on the bottom.
