# Rockfish Salad
## 16 January 2011 7:34 AM

Shit, I didn't take a photo and I've
run out of fish.  Oh well, isn't this
rockfish adorable?  The photo was
taken by [Joyce Feuerbacher Altgelt][1],
apparently.
I usually eat this quickly because I want it to go away. The salad without the fish would be appealing, but here it serves mostly to mask the flavor of the slimy, five-day-old fish. Seriously, in the fridge the cooked fish gained a layer of transparent slime at the bottom. Okay, fine, it's not that it tastes or smells particularly bad, but the idea of it makes me feel it will taste bad enough to make me vomit at any moment. Eating it is an exercise in repressing a nausea of potential. It only came about because of one of my dad's Costco misadventures, in which he bought far too much salad greens and rockfish.



Without further ado, here is a recipe for an undesirable salad that came about in peculiar circumstances.



2-3 large handfulls salad greens
~1/2 cup cooked rockfish
8 kalamata olives
1/2 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1/2 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon honey

In a large bowl place salad greens.  Tear olives in half into salad.  Tear bite-sized pieces of rockfish into salad.  Drizzle balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and honey over salad.  Sprinkle salt and pepper over salad.  Write one more sentence that ends in "salad," just in case your readers missed that everything was going into the salad.
