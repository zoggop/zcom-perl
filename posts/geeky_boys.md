### Art Imitating Art

Just about every sci-fi or fantasy action sequence reminds me of playing with legos. Not putting them together, but pretending that the things I built were swooping around. It's really hard to watch Gandalf casting spheres of light without imagining a 6-year-old making fwoosh sounds. CGI is the perfect medium to realize such childhood fantasies of attraction, repulsion, and color. These must've come from watching older special effects, the sounds of which one emulates with an incidental spray of spittle.

### Guns

Over the course of a few late nights I played through *X-Com*. All the guns are pump-action, reloaded with a hand running along the barrel. The sniper rifles telescope outward before firing. The more powerful the weapon, the higher the volume of stuff shooting out of it.

For those nights my dreams were troubled by unsolvable puzzles. Not really puzzles, just making slightly different moves, none of which solved whatever it was I had to solve. I woke tense, as if late for something. Someone I know watches *Too Cute* as a lullaby, turning her dreams into a different kind of treading water.

### The Most Obvious

He starts talking about what "we" once had, once did, about "reaching" once more "to make known the unknown." And there you are: a rocket blasting off.

### Lazy

The geek trio in *Buffy* become villains because they can't think of anything better to do. Buffy's off doing thankless labour that Sunnydale's very existence depends upon, and they play all day. Living at all is an effort for depressed Season 6 Buffy. The trio do what they enjoy, and they get a room full of cash. What they enjoy isn't enough, though. They need someone to harass, and ultimately, some people to dominate to give their lives meaning. If only Silicon Valley startups understood themselves this well.
