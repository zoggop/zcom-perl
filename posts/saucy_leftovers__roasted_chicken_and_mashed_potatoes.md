# saucy leftovers: roasted chicken and mashed potatoes
## 1 September 2010 2:49 AM

sauce:

2 tablespoons butter


1/3-1/2 cup heavy cream

1 tablespoon mashed potatoes

~12 fresh sage leaves

1/2 teaspoon salt




sauceand:

a small pile of pieces of roasted chicken

~1 cup mashed potatoes




melt butter in a large saucepan on medium-low heat.  once melted, add sage leaves and fry until crispy.  butter should brown a little, but not blacken (if it does heat is too high).  remove sage leaves with a fork and set aside.  add heavy cream, tablespoon of mashed potatoes, and salt to saucepan, and stir thoroughly with a whisk.  lower heat a little and simmer until sauce reaches a somewhat thickened but still flowing consistency--this should take only a couple minutes.




heat up chicken pieces and mashed potatoes in somehow (a microwave probably), pour sauce on top, and garnish with crispy sage leaves.
