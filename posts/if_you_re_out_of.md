# If you're out of 
## 12 September 2013 9:06 PM

If you're out of place, the first thing to do is grovel. Grovel so that you don't appear to be looking for thanks. Do the nicest thing in the most invisible way.

Anyway, you want to walk their dog.

It's not the dog's fault his owner brought no food and no leash. It's not the dog's fault he pees on food, tents, and feet. Or that he humps anything he can wrap his legs around.

It's not his fault he thought there was a party here. It being a party, he plays his digiridoo. His "doo," he calls it. The world provides. It's a miracle, like the sound of his doo. His doo makes the world complete. It makes the stars that much brighter as they shoot--isn't it dope that stars can fly so fast? It warms the night and materializes beer in everyone's hands. Or at least in boxes into which they reach. He doesn't know how it's possible, but his doo is the center of it all. He's not sure he belives it. He leans into a tent--somehow, it unzips--and asks "is my doo making your dreams better?"

"Your what?"

"My digiridoo, sister."

"No."

You come back with the dog to see the tent zipping, and a series of cognitive calisthenics go through you like metal hooks. He doesn't know what he does. He never does. There's no explanation. It's just him. It's nothing.

The next night, there are even more shooting stars. You said nothing about nothing, but you have convinced him not to play his digiridoo. He sits restlessly modulating his hand to a gyrating metal ball, something you realize takes great love. A love of a metal ball. He feels its movement and anticipates it, so that it spins even faster.

He hands the metal ball to her. Her hands don't move. It wobbles frantically and drops to the ground.

Clack clack clack, goes some ratchet inside.

You see white streak from one black tree to another. Are there fewer stars left now?

"That was a big one. Make a wish," she tells you.

"Do you have wishes?"

You didn't intend to say that out loud. Why speak when the words will pass? It's just chemical. It's all chemical.

"It's all physical," she's saying. "Human touch is the most important thing for mental health." She leans into him, caressing his shoulder, and as if to demonstrate she smiles. You've felt his shoulder against you many times, but you wonder what it feels like.

"You know when things are happening around you, but they're so distant, you're in another world?"

She said that? Spoke the imbalance in her brain?

"I'm just so into eating this corn on the cob. That's what it's like. I don't even know what's going on around me, it's so good."

His corn on the cob. He wrapped it in foil and threw it in the hot coals for her. In lieu of the digiridoo, he cooks for everyone.

"If I ever catch a girl cheating, man, that's it."

"Are you polyamorous?"

They don't think you hear them. Everyone underestimates earshot. Rules vibrate the air, elusive yet tantalizing. It's the one thing he can't stand, cheating. Yet she asks about polyamory.

"Then there are those people who don't have sex"--his tone says it's impossible.

"Asexual, you mean?"

"No, celibate." In his best camp voice, he mock-whines "I'm a celibate asexual. I'm pure. I never have sex."

Over his shoulder you watch him frame three legs (where is the fourth?) spilling out of a tent. "There is something evocative about those legs," he says in that accent that can only be characterized as Ibiza, even though he's never been there.

Another star. "Sex has nothing to do with love." You say it would be wonderful if stars really did move like that. You say a lot of things. You say you'd love to be photographed, "by all means." You say happy birthday. You say you agree. You say the meteor--you think of them as meteors--is awesome. You say you made a wish.
