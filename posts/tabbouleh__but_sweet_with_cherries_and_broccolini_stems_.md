1 cup bulgur wheat
2 1/2 cups water

let stand for about half an hour
rinse with cold water
drain
cover and cool in refrigerator

1 cup chopped broccolini stems
pieces should be about 1cm square
sautee on medium heat in a little oil until soft but not smooshy

1/4 cup olive oil
1 cup julienned fresh basil
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1-2 teaspoons salt (possibly more, mix in 1 tsp and adjust to taste)

once bulgur is cool enough not to wilt fresh basil, add everything (olive oil, basil, salt, sauteed broccolini stems, sweet cherry mixture) into cooked bulgur and mix well
