# Yogurt Pancakes
## 13 February 2011 10:59 PM




2 eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
whole wheat pastry flour
2 tablespoons yogurt
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
pinch of salt
1 teaspoon baking powder

In a medium bowl mix together eggs, yogurt, oil, and salt. Whisk in 2 tablespoons flour. Whisk in milk. Whisk in 3 more tablespoons flour and baking powder. Continue adding more flour until the batter is slightly wetter than the desired consistency. Whisk, whisk, whisk. It will thicken a little more as the whole wheat pastry flour absorbs more moisture. Fry pancakes in a pan on medium heat, flipping each when the top has lots of bubbles. I eat them with butter and maple syrup.
