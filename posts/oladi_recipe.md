# Oladi Recipe
## 19 October 2011 8:57 PM

Just an addendum to [last night's post][1]. I made oladi this morning and discovered that [the second google hit][2]'s recipe is also really off. It calls for twice as much flour than I found created a nice consistency.



1 egg
a little less than 1 cup of kefir
3/4 cup flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
a pinch of salt

Crack egg into a 2-cup measuring cup. Fill to the 1 cup mark with kefir. Add sugar and salt. Mix until the egg is well integrated. Add flour and baking soda. Mix with a fork or a whisk at first slowly and then rapidly to get out the lumps of flour. Onto a skillet on medium heat, pour batter in roughly 3-tablespoon dollops. Fry for a minute or two on both sides, or until well browned and fluffy.
