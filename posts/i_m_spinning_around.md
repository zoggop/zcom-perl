# I'm Spinning Around
## 9 October 2013 5:16 AM


On a visceral level, *Gravity* is a masterpiece. For an hour and a half, the tension never abates but for ten seconds, once. Ryan (Sandra Bullock) immediately has the sympathy of my guts: As the camera sadistically toys with my inner ears and sense of persistance (objects living and dead are only at newtonian rest--relatively, they're slamming about wily-nilly), she feels "no more nauseous than usual."

The two male astronauts drift without concern (one playing with his tether and giggling, the other completely satisfied by his own charming monologue--that's George Clooney, of course). She's terrified yet distant, which apparently is notable. Even enough for one of those heart-to-heart interrogations full of "come on..." As the ostensibly attached grope for attachments. Ryan says that at home she doesn't go home, she "just drives" after work.

But in this fishing known as Character, eventually something gets snagged. Her backstory--it's always *this big*--is grief: her daughter died. And now you probably see the plot. She will have an emotional journey in which she will, with a large helping of mortal danger, digest grief into an affirmation of life.

Conveniently, when she realizes "I'm going to die today," the sound of a baby crying comes over the AM. At least it wasn't followed up by "The Circle of Life," but it may as well have been.

Someone I know suggests that stills are better than movies. "That is the logic that sustains *La Jetee*." *Gravity* is sustained by just the opposite. Every transition between continuous real-time scenes, however short and however rare, feels like a compromise for Alfonso Cuar√≥n. The moment preserved is nothing. The stuckness of melancholy is a waste. Every thing and every one (especially Ryan) must keep in motion.

Ryan finally makes it to earth, a dripping mess on the beach. Maybe she never passed it (her daughter). Maybe this [reborn][1] Ryan--the one that exclaims "no more just driving, I want to go home"--is a hairball?
