# when there's too much basil and some tomatoes are on the verge of rotting... and bacon
## 13 August 2010 6:31 PM

4 medium-small fresh tomatoes
2 strips bacon
1/2 of a medium onion
1 clove garlic
1/2 lemon
small handful of julienned fresh basil
2 springs fresh oregano
1 teaspoon black pepper
salt to taste (you probably won't need it, the bacon is of course salty)

Chop the half onion and garlic as finely as possible.  Sautee in a bit of oil on medium-low heat (don't burn).
Chop the two least ripe tomatoes into small chunks.  In another pan with a little oil at the bottom simmer these tomatoes.
Stir the onions and the tomatoes every couple minutes.  When the onions are fairly soft (10-15 minutes?), chop the bacon into small pieces and add to the pan of onions.  Turn the heat up a little, and fry for two or three minutes.  Then add the simmering tomatoes, and the black pepper.
Slice the remaining tomatoes radially, julienne the basil, and pick the leaves from the oregano stems.
Once the sauce in the pan is very thick, add the remaining tomatoes, basil, oregano, and squeeze the lemon half.  Cook just until the basil is wilted.
Eat over pasta.
