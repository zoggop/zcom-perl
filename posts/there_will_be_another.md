# There will be another 
## 22 July 2013 7:19 PM

There will be another season in all of three months, and maybe another after that, but I miss Scandal. I miss its photography, preoccupied with gazing through sharp-angled glass. I miss the solid yet mercurial Olivia Pope, at once absent and an indominable presence. I miss its monologues with their sometimes absurdly relentless cadence, one short sentence after another starting with the same words.

*Scandal*, however, is not in the business of missing. While season two muddies itself in flashbacks to the formative and erotic campaign trail, it's not because these were better days. If Pope is in any way catholic, it's in her prediliction for baptism. One episode begins with her plunging into a pool, which  if our eyes are to be trusted, is filled with memories of Fitz. She swims in kisses and caresses to rid herself of them. (Fitz, meanwhile, showers these same memories off while receiving the wrongest martial fidelity in the form of a blow job.)

Intriguingly, neither these memories nor the secrets kept between scenes create a sense of interior. Olivia might omit a few things, but her private world, as well as everyone else's, is out of bounds.

Olivia is not interested in the past. If she wants to know about it, it's because she needs her client's confession before she may save them. (Okay, maybe more ways that one.)

To watch *Scandal* is to see double, at least. Its stereovision is more than its obsession with the prisms of sharp-angled windows, or the opposition of optics and truth. Neither Mellie nor Cyrus see the whole picture when she says of appearances "that's what's real," and he, "we both know happy people are rarely actually happy, unless they're morons." Both have a whiff of truth, and both swap their concerns. Mellie can't stand the reality of her husband's passion for Olivia while the public perceives a good marriage. Cyrus's cynical grip on "reality" paves the way for the most maniacal manipulations of perception.

Mellie is calculated to be a grating character along unsettlingly sexist lines: she's shrill, jealous, and vindictive. So Fitz's explosion at her is perfect:

Here Fitz becomes, instead of just a half-mad Victorian object of female passion, as horrible as Don Draper. Soon he yields a line as hilarious as /name/ proclaiming of a group of women that "they bought paradise" in Top of the Lake: "they worked together. They *worked together*." They are Mellie and Olivia--"my women."

Olivia Pope's boringest suitor asks her, with a business-like phrase, "you're all in?" When she replies "I'm all in," she's all out.

The short first season is somewhat of a throwback for having monsters of the week. Each episode had two clients who needed fixing, but the two never slumped into parallelism or point-counterpoint. They seem not to have been chosen for their symbolic resonances but for their practical disparity. The second season toys with this format at first, but soon does away with it.

If I spoke only in zeitgeisty pronouncements, I would say that the novel is dead, that the only valid art today is performative, that privacy is not only a silly thing to be indignant about, but isn't a thing. But the statement "you only exist in photographs" comes from a novel (*How Should a Person Be?*), and the show takes the saturation of surveilance for granted performs vision tripping over itself.



Olivia and Edison's relationship exists in photographs. Even before the photographs are revealed, there is an unseemly feeling that the two are being watched. He acts too publicly, too reasonably, too dryly. The photographs show all this. They didn't know they were being watched, but the photographs look staged. Their relationship is political; one can see the spin in their eyes.

Watching *Scandal*, one sees double, at least. Does one love Olivia Pope, then, in stereo, or in 3D? She is as solid a character as there is, and yet mercury. Some (men) wish to freeze-frame her, preferring either the sad, helpless-looking Olivia, or the all-powerful, angry Olivia who fixes people.

She is capable of saying to a politician aspiring to a greater office "you haven't dated anyone in the last ten years. [...] You don't date. You don't go out. You don't meet women, and you don't have sex with anybody. Why." While she herself does not date. It would be stupid to write this off as "hypocracy."

There's an ugly word for her inconsistency with Fitz, too. She makes out with him, she pushes him away, she plans her life with him, she decides it would never work. "Oh come on, Liv," Fitz complains. He too runs hot and cold, but apparently this is his right as a man. A woman is supposed to choose and stick with it. Because obviously, feeling and reason have nothing to do with each other.

As a narrator, Lucy Snowe is a more cereberal character, but there is a strong resemblence in her comfort with change and uncertainty. Of watching other's emotional displays (there is a lot of that on *Scandal*) she says that

>It was a scene of feeling too brimful, and which, because the cup did not foam up high or furiously overflow, only oppressed one the more. On all occasions of vehement, unrestrained expansion, a sense of disdain or ridicule comes to the weary spectator's relief; whereas I have ever felt most burdensome that sort of sensibility which bends of its own will, a giant slave under the sway of good sense.

There is a bit of both on *Scandal*: The emotional displays between Fitz and Olivia are tiresome, but the show would have no teeth it or Olivia were ruled only by good sense.

Edison, one of the men who courting her, is staggeringly dull because his good sense only arouses Olivia to the same. After much back-and-forth, she finally decides "I want crazy, dangerous love." But the problem with him is not just the lack of passion; it's also a matter of public and private. /elaborate/***END OF FILE***
