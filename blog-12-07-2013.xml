type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I was driving into the sun. I couldn't see the signals without nearly blocking them out with my hand. There were dark streaks on the pavement--those must've been people. Those driving towards me, I realized, would never guess that those of us driving the other way were nearly blinded. To them, we just looked exceptionally well-lit. I slowed down, afraid I would run into one of them. I wished for sunglasses, and wondered why is the light like this in winter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm becoming convinced that "it's always darkest before the light" is a convenient distortion. Isn't it always lightest when it's darkest? Fall kills all the leaves, and they glow warmly in the cold before dropping off entirely, removing all obscurity but the bare limbs. Whenever I go outside it's pure glare--the cars are white flares, even the nearest mountains are nearly the color of the sky. If it snows, the ground becomes painful to look at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn't see the speedometer because it was all green. When I finally turned off from that street perfectly aligned with the sun and arrived at my brother's house, everything was still green, as it is, as if the leaves are haunting us (it's all about the trees, clearly). But it would sound strange to mention after-images. What can one say but hello?&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6886229060011315857/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/11/why-doesnt-this-happen-to-people-all.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6886229060011315857'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6886229060011315857'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/11/why-doesnt-this-happen-to-people-all.html' title='why doesn&apos;t this happen to people all the time?'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8817847792023299309</id><published>2013-11-27T09:04:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2013-11-27T09:04:37.822-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'></content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8817847792023299309'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8817847792023299309'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-9018149848629058466</id><published>2013-11-19T15:23:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2013-11-21T14:12:23.190-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>Ender's Tears</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ender? What kind of a name is that?&amp;quot; It's a question with the ring of a margin note, like the rest of this script. There's a boot camp for kids in the sky, and Harrison Ford (Colonel Graff) and Viola Davis (Major Anderson) occupy its panoptic center, but it feels more like the writers' room. When Anderson first meets Ender, she informs Graff &amp;quot;he has a complex response to authority. He doesn't want to displease the stern father figure [Graff].&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has also installed a game on Ender's military-issue iPad called &amp;quot;Mind Game,&amp;quot; for which she argues &amp;quot;we need a way to monitor his emotional state.&amp;quot; Graff, true to his scarily on the nose role of Stern Father Figure, says &amp;quot;I don't care how he's &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt;--I need to start toughening him up.&amp;quot; He's doubly wrong: We &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; need a way to monitor Ender's emotional state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though he really just has two: aggression and remorse. The sibling psychodrama of this is skimmed over--he just makes one remark about how he has to &amp;quot;balance&amp;quot; the emotional excesses of his brother and sister (the brother is basically a sociopath, the sister has too much empathy). He seems awfully free of delusions about the difference between himself and his siblings. I shouldn't expect too much of this movie, but &lt;em&gt;May We Be Forgiven&lt;/em&gt; does this better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, he beats up bullies and then feels bad about it. When this pattern escalates to wiping out an entire alien species, he's devastated. Given the relative timeliness of the release (there are drone pilots and some heavily 9/11-flavored posters that say &amp;quot;never forget&amp;quot;), the horror of actually annihilating another race by preemptive strike is not a bad statement at all. But--maybe because this is a film with a cast of children, and the producers were therefore uncomfortable with anything too disturbing--the movie goes on to include the redemptive beginning of the next book, so that we might be released from the gravity of annihilating the other. Ender realizes that there's still an alien queen alive, and goes to find her. Whereupon he cries, and she &lt;em&gt;caresses his tears&lt;/em&gt;. She bestows her only egg on him so that he can &amp;quot;travel the universe&amp;quot; on a heroic mission to find the egg a home. The story gets deprived of meaning because it all becomes merely something to provide meaning to his character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On &lt;em&gt;Downton Abbey&lt;/em&gt; a husband learns that his wife was raped and he assures her &amp;quot;no, no, you're more precious to me &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of what has happened to you.&amp;quot; It's not quite the same thing, but &lt;em&gt;Ender's Game&lt;/em&gt; is at least half as gross. The important thing, apparently, isn't that an ethics includes others (as would be appropriate in a story that explores the nature of empathy), but the depth of feeling one has for their suffering. Ender is that bleeding heart who reads about starving children in Africa, feels terrible, and writes a check. The movie would have it that the problem with tyrants (like Graff) isn't the way they understand the world outside of themselves, but their heartlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, Ender is a &lt;a href="http://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/politicalfeeling/files/2007/09/berlant-lauren-th_subject_of_true_feeling.pdf"&gt;subject of true feeling&lt;/a&gt;. I suppose this isn't a surprising way for a movie to humanize a character from a novel. I don't remember reading Ender being dependant on likeability. Granted, I don't remember the novel all that well, because I read it when I was a teenager. But I remember it being more disturbing. What happened at the school was far nastier than the fairly normal boarding school antics that made it to the movie, and Ender himself was nastier. At times I felt like I was watching an inspirational sports film. Hooray, Ender's team of misfits win through ingenuity, leadership, and team spirit! The only hint of Ender's intense ruthlessness here is when, confronted with the unwinnable Mind Game, he gnaws out the game proctor's eye socket. (He's a mouse, and the proctor is a computer construct.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adults are far less convincing than the children. Viola Davis seems bored. Ben Kingsley as Mysterious Guru is the worst. At least Harrison Ford has those wonderful ears, which preempt his face in expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/11/enders-tears.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/9018149848629058466'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/9018149848629058466'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-6071761427503588792</id><published>2013-11-17T01:01:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2013-11-17T10:06:07.188-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>Thor: The Jumpy World</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;The main thing about Thor is: he jumps. Like a yellow lab tethered to a stick, he's flung as much as he flings his hammer--an object of which he &amp;quot;will try to be worthy.&amp;quot; I have a sketchy feeling there's something reversed about that, but I'm certain that villains stop thrown objects. Hence the hero's motivating envy, because his life is all topsy-turvy. Thor hops between planets more impulsively than we hop between countries. He appears behind a woman with a magical umbrella to shelter her from the storm that follows him around (a bit troubling, I know). He, ahem, crosses stars to save the damsel he sneaks up on. His brother, the ur-trickster, is no help. It's not even clear the writers know what he wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, what kind of story is Thor in? At first I thought (with glee) he was in a princess plot. His stern, battle-scarred father (so stern he has to speak in tedious implicatives to say anything kind) wants him to have a practical marriage to the warrior princess (an obvious choice, as she appears to be the only female warrior in the nine realms, and indeed, one of two non-mortal females). But he doesn't love her, daddy. Sadly that is not the story. There is a kind of metaphorical rape-revenge plot, which seems totally thoughtless. Jane gets unwillingly invaded by a malevolent liquid called &amp;quot;the ether,&amp;quot; which makes her faint, turns her eyes black, and violently dispatches anyone who tries to touch her other than Thor. For half the movie she's just wandering around asking &amp;quot;how do I get it out of me?&amp;quot; Once the evil elf man sucks it out of her, somehow it becomes power to wield instead of burden to bear. Hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is that the story? There's also a caper. The gang of vaguely recognizable warrior-buddies rescue Jane, free Loki, and dash off through Loki's secret passage. On the way there, one of the gang turns it into a pirate movie for five seconds, swinging by rope from one ship to another. There's also a few minutes of Star Wars, all pwee-pwee dogfight and destructive sperm trying to enter a well-protected sphere. And some grave Peter Jacksonesque mythological backstory, complete with CGI battles with elves. By the way, about the ether, Thor tells power-hungry Loki &amp;quot;you cannot wield it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fittingly, the overarching plot becomes in the end about the colliding of worlds. Things fly wily-nilly in and out of portals. Thor is in his element, jumping around blind trying to stop bad things. In this case, he must stop the elf from bringing about that venerable standby of diabolic plots: the destruction of the universe. This vampirically pale man has plunged his dagger-like ship smack in the middle of Greenwich, like a burning cross, or a to-scale Google Earth pin. Because with a flourish lifted from Ancient Aliens wingnuttery, all the great wonders of the world point to Greenwich. All the portals float overhead there, variously inbibing and disgorging villain, henchmen, hero, sidekicks. It does seem the logical aesthetic climax of such a mishmash of tones and genres. It felt much like a firework: a bunch of sparkles and pops, accompanied by a concussive bang and a dispersal of glowy bits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I would prefer the barriers between worlds didn't collapse. Thor and Jane are more bearable when they can't reach each other. The pining shakes them up a bit, and for that short moment they have pathos, even if it can only be signified by a black cloak or a half-hearted date. When they meet, the instant affection runs an iron over them. I think this long distance thing is working just fine for them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6071761427503588792/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/11/thor-jumpy-world.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6071761427503588792'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6071761427503588792'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/11/thor-jumpy-world.html' title='Thor: The Jumpy World'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-109942702837215162</id><published>2013-11-06T22:32:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2013-11-09T00:42:31.259-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>Enough Said</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;The title gives the impression of a movie fed up with speech. And its dialogue feels driven by pity for speaking. There are few lines whose comedy is seperable from the empathetic cringe they induce. But are words really the issue?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warp of the movie is awkwardness, the weft, aggression. When Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) blurts something blunt, she gives a shot of color to a surprisingly drab California cloth of mildly painful fake warmth. The pain is nothing more fantastical than everyday interpersonal drain--that seemingly impossible rule that, contrary to Paul McCartney's maxim, the love you take is just a little bit less than the love you make. As a messuse, Eva gives the strength of her hands and in return she puts up with her clients' unwelcome intimacy. They babble, they groan, they have bad breath, they don't offer to help her with her massage table up two flights of stairs. The debt is repaid in money, as it tends to be. The math may not work, but it has to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(One needs a hand massage to give a hand massage.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a decade later, I still remember Ben Bova's &lt;em&gt;Mars&lt;/em&gt; for the dust. It got into everything. Well-marinated in their own granular atmosphere, these are not characters that connect. The closeness of Eva and Albert's (James Gandolfini) dates is just close mutual scrutiny, with a bit of irony to make the lines they're drawing around each other bearably sketchy. Their flirting is somehow composed of anti-play, that substance that can be found in children's assessments of their peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throw a few of these miserable couples together, and we get an exchange of cheery bile (a dinner party). Every pet peeve is aired; everyone lives up to their cariacature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Enough Said&lt;/em&gt; performs a jaw-dropping feat of instrumental delusion. I have too strong a desire for truth-telling, so I was revolted, but I have to congratulate the movie's one act of imagination. It might live, after all. Relationships are only hard because they can be &amp;quot;poisoned&amp;quot; by too much critical talk. It's true that once criticism gets rolling, it's hard to stop, but here there's a convenient scapegoat: Albert's ex wife, who has aired everything she couldn't stand about him. It's perfect for Eva. She gets an actual person on whom to offload all her negativity. She doesn't have to partition herself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/109942702837215162/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/11/enough-said.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/109942702837215162'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/109942702837215162'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/11/enough-said.html' title='Enough Said'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4714985848820786676</id><published>2013-10-28T18:58:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2013-10-28T19:54:11.996-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Chantrelle Hunting and Net Cleaning</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;One Jack O Latern is eating the other, smaller one. They're both smiling. &amp;quot;Do we light another candle in the little one?&amp;quot; One hopes that question is anachronistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The icy water gives me a hollow ringing in my head, but my numb hands burn up. It shocked me at first, this feeling that my hands couldn't stand going back in the water. Not because it was surprising that cold water is cold, but because all I could say about it was that it's really cold, pause. He suggested gloves. It's a common complaint that men hear complaints as repair requests, one I am too happy to deploy, but it was a good idea. I think I haven't looked for gloves because that would be giving up the part of the job I look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can one be blunted? At the least, one needs bluntness sometimes. &amp;quot;Do you enjoy these things?&amp;quot; No, but I need them. Is enjoyment fair to ask?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flavor of chantrelles is hard to define, but umistakeable, maybe even a little grotesque. Raw, they're reputedly &amp;quot;peppery and upsetting.&amp;quot; They're supposed to smell like apricots, which sounds like synesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hills look golden these days, but those same oak leaves up close are a dull ochre. Looking and being might be the other way around. The leaves are all precious anyway, rotten spots and all, until they wash down into the net. Left alone, the net becomes a dam, the water overflows. Why clean the net?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why find new ways to faint? I have forgotten to say that cleaning the net is work. The question of whether it's worth it--the degree to which work releases from work--is replaced by the fact that I have to do it. I said I look forward to it, but I try to avoid it. I'm sick of the monotony of the routine that surrounds it, but I'm sick of my routine being interrupted by scraping every leaf-clogged surface of the net.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunting for mushrooms is actually two things, searching and finding. It's almost annoying to have to stop looking to get down on my knees and collect the trove. Greed turns into the work of brushing off dirt and needles, plucking each mushroom and deciding if it's too damp, too dry, too moldy, too difficult to clean. Soon they're all uprooted, and I'm once again interrupted to go back to looking intently at the forest floor. It's no wonder that after only an hour of this, it's all ennui. Mushrooms as good as those jostling around in my backpack are no longer perfect enough to bother with. Even a largish patch just looks like effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's the trouble with eating them, too: Given the hour-long drive on a sick-inducing road, it only makes sense to gather them in large quantitites. And what does one do with that many chantrelles? It's not a flavor I want in every meal, but there they are. Supposedly they freeze well, but freezers require trust, and I suspect them of mangling the texture of everything. The only option, really, is sharing them as widely as possible. It's not altruism it's ventriloquism. I imagine their taste is more appreciated by those who aren't stuck with them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/4714985848820786676/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/10/chantrelle-hunting-and-net-cleaning.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4714985848820786676'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4714985848820786676'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/10/chantrelle-hunting-and-net-cleaning.html' title='Chantrelle Hunting and Net Cleaning'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-6625931887937480568</id><published>2013-10-18T22:34:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2013-10-19T09:40:39.275-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>After I wrote this I realized the fruit cake is delicious.</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eraserhead&lt;/em&gt; is a nightmare of fatherhood, but its problem is matter. For the moment, mine is persistence--&amp;quot;nothIng's more changeable than a young man's heart,&amp;quot; as Mrs. Patmore puts it, before a cut to a young man carrying flowers. I would say that &lt;em&gt;Downton Abbey&lt;/em&gt;'s scene-to-scene cuts have gotten less subtle, but it's been pointed out to me &lt;em&gt;Downton&lt;/em&gt; is the model of consistency. It's true, or at least, one has to get one's bearings somehow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First let me say that &lt;a href="http://www.nigella.com/recipes/view/gorgeously-golden-fruit-cake"&gt;Nigella's choice of fruit cake fruit&lt;/a&gt; are a stroke of genius. But I only realized this at first glance, and then later, when I tasted my one slapdash substitution. I convinced myself that figs might actually be better than pears. Figs are twofaced. Fresh, they are lush; they carry just the right hint of exoticism requisite for winter sweets. But dried, I can only taste fig newtons. These ones had me confused: they were a cheery yellow on the outside. How could they taste like the filling of a mealy cookie? Nigella's choices had worked all this out to arrive at a consistently sunny tone, by eschewing both the obvious tropical choices and the somber traditionals. Apricots, pears, and golden raisins (in her parlance, sultanas, which sounds as good as the figs looked).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But dried pears were nowhere to be found, and my &amp;quot;contribution&amp;quot; started to sound better, in retrospect, because it was there, because I wanted the fruit I had already bought to matter. This bizzarre aspect of my heart became apparent when I took a bite of the cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fruit cake is so dense it takes more than a night to cool, so to arrive at this point involved about twenty-four hours of zig-zagging. My baking partner had her doubts and therefore I did. Making the cake was the reverse of a Sarah Waters novel: every step made me more uncertain it was a good idea, so that the end result only confirmed my suspicions. No, that's a lie, I had never smelled anything so good as dried fruit simmering in rum and butter. I was in love until I held its weight. It was one in the morning. It had been cooling for several hours and it was still hot (more evidence of its superpastry density). I suddenly felt very tired. Or maybe I had been yawning the whole time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, the evidence of one's own self-servingness, however obscure, is never very welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6625931887937480568/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/10/after-i-wrote-this-i-realized-fruit.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6625931887937480568'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6625931887937480568'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/10/after-i-wrote-this-i-realized-fruit.html' title='After I wrote this I realized the fruit cake is delicious.'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4914187772917375488</id><published>2013-09-29T02:32:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2013-10-01T12:26:58.776-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Pressure Systems</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Seasons are a ploy. A New season can fall instantly (in this week's case, like a grey blanket), yet it sneaks. The beginning of every season is an opportunity to toy with forever: what will life look like from now on? There's an &amp;quot;until,&amp;quot; but ignore it. Three months is a lifetime. Except when you hear a date six months in the future, and realize it's almost here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's 60 degrees and drizzly, and I'm already calling it Winter. Fall and Spring are intermediaries; Winter and Summer allow me to cultivate delusions of time depressurized. The difference is the setting: inside with endless cups of tea, or outside under a tree. There seems to be a presence there, in the seasonal rescue from the current. Holing up or getting lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, Christmas cookies. Making them is a tedious ritual lasting several days. The point isn't the cookies themselves, but the needless work. If I'm lucky, I can get lost in the tactile kingdom of dough. Is this more, or less difficult alone? It can be a social event, cookie-making, but company is only a means to an end. If the weather is just right, it's easier to forget in company. It can despine conciousness, which can get like a cactus, cooking alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter is supposed to be the season of gluttony, but when it's me who has to cook, it ends up being the season of neglect. Tea for breakfast, because it's as a ritual it calms rather than disorganizes. It's not that food is so distasteful in the morning, but the thought of thinking about food is too much to bear. I get desperate sometime in the evening, but if nothing is at hand, hunger transmutes into simple exhaustion, and I can go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, hunger and restlessness and intimately related. Being sick of something feels like hunger. Hunger can coexist with involvement, but it's almost soothingly far off, like thunder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you can imagine the appeal of &lt;a href="http://thestandardoftaste.wordpress.com/2012/04/04/christmas-recipe-4-how-to-make-marzipan-fruit/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; to me. I don't particularly want marzipan fruit, but I imagine the required attention to detail will save me. My habit is to call this kind of focus a rest from language. But restlessness also falls away when I'm working on a piece of code, which is as symbolic an activity as I can imagine. On the other hand, writing prose is a performance, so self-consciousness cannot entirely leave the picture. The difference isn't quite the addictive properties of playing god. Restlessness might recede in the imaginitive part of writing fiction, but one doesn't come away in quite the same clockwork daze. Someone I know drifts from conversation into engineering drawings. The need to tinker persists as an insulating itch. Rather than starting far away, writing tends to overknead its relation to the world. It's much like conversation: everything that could've been put differently comes back like sports commentator video loops. (Maybe that's the redemptive dream of watching football, a sport that spends a lot of time considering very short plays: that anyalsis and second-guessing have value?) Post-programming, my head fills with everything I will &lt;em&gt;do next&lt;/em&gt;--the red shoes of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phenomenologically, programming is thoroughly technical. It has more in common with home improvement than prose or cookie-making. Cookies seem like they might save me from both. Where writing involves an fraught distance/intimacy with oneself, and programming liquidates experience for products, a craft takes the air out of the self and is only productive as an excuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that's just how I imagine it. I'm not that patient. Every little tectonic shift in experience, like the seasons, are there to negate. A few hours meticulously painting marzipan, and I can feel like never doing it again. That's the product: being over it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/4914187772917375488/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/09/pressure-systems.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4914187772917375488'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4914187772917375488'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/09/pressure-systems.html' title='Pressure Systems'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-3771152704105167954</id><published>2013-09-20T19:18:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2013-09-20T19:18:45.279-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'></content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/09/blog-post.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3771152704105167954'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3771152704105167954'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4676946103739306274</id><published>2013-09-17T15:32:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2013-09-17T15:32:35.779-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>V.I.

The worse the adaptation, the better. Loving, faithful adaptations merely&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;sell&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;books. Watching “V.I. Warshawski”&amp;nbsp;turned me into a raving fanatic. Well, not immediately. You know how shock can be exhausting? First I had to go lay down for a while. Then I began foaming at the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except at a very general level, I had no idea what was going on in this film. I stopped trying to understand at the first diversion from the source material. The plot is a series of overexcited facebook statuses from on vacation in the first two V.I. Warshawski novels, &lt;i&gt;Indemnity Only&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Deadlock&lt;/i&gt;. The facts and characters are there, sort of--hacked up and glued back together with the care of an infant--but the murder mystery is indecipherable. The attitude toward the source material is precisely that of a tourist: what isn’t ignored is iced with romance extruded from a pastry bag known as the anus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the murder victim, who in &lt;i&gt;Deadlock&lt;/i&gt; is Warshawski’s hockey-player cousin to whom she had been close. The facebook status reads: “I met this amazing hockey hunk! But he died! We were totally soul-mates. RIP.” Yes, in the book she’s investigating the murder of her cousin out of love (ostensibly--really it’s obsession), but the kind that she might actually take seriously, not the googley-eyed, i-met-him-in-a-bar-last-night variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She takes his case when he comes uninvited into her apartment with a relative’s daughter, asks her to take care of the kid for a while, and hires her to investigate something about the company he works for. Except he has no money at the moment. I find myself doubting that she would give a shit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is accomplished by actually meeting him before he’s murdered? We get to see how she snares a man? She does it in the least Warshawski way: She trips him and when her shoe falls off the two are led into painfully nonwitty Cindarella banter. That’s the kind of stunt she might pull to persue a case--maybe--but to get the attention of a man she’s attracted to? I imagine the screenwriter’s logic went something like this: Hey, this Warshawski, she’s sexy, right? Let’s make it a romantic comedy! Despite the fact that the books never even approach romantic comedy. There is romance, technically, and it can be comedic, but her flings are a part of the detective story, not the other away around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real narrative arc here, grafted on awkwardly, is her relationship with the newspaper reporter, Murray. First she rejects him (for waltzing into her apartment unannounced and without permission)--which clearly cannot stand, she has to have a man in her life. Then she gets drugged, turns sappy, and asks him to stay the night with her. Finally, in an explosion of not so much sap as syrup, she reconciles with him. Again, a tourist’s utter incomprehension is at work here. In the books Warshawski refers to her “relationship” with Murray. There’s a reason this word can cause nervousness. Here it’s been taken to mean serious, committed relationship whose problems must be resolved so that it may become real. Because clearly the ultimate goal in Warshawski’s life is to find a fulfilling relationship with a man. If there’s anyone with whom she has a serious, comitted relationship, it’s Lotty, the Austrian doctor who takes care of and shelters her when she’s in trouble. They love each other, and she &lt;i&gt;needs&lt;/i&gt; Lotty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, the script takes the perspective of a character who has never been anything more than comic relief, a foil for Warshawski to shine with snide remarks: Bobby Mallory. A friend of her father’s, he constantly heckles her to stop fooling around in dangerous detective work (“no place for a woman”) and to find a good man with whom to settle down. He’s a cliche, a punching bag, an antifeminist archaic for her to righteously drown with modernity. Which is fine by me. The point is he’s not someone to &lt;i&gt;take seriously&lt;/i&gt;. That’s the most off-putting thing about seeing Bobby on screen in this film: It’s possible to listen to an entire sentence of his speech without ROFLing. Congratulations, director I’ve never heard of, you have declawed V.I. Warshawski.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So too her inconsistent attention to the cleanliness of her apartment. It has been exploded into a comedy of slovenliness. In the books she leaves her dishes unwashed for a couple days, and sometimes neglects cleaning her apartment when it needs it. Why? because she has better things to do, not because she’s a slob. And who cares if she is? But here the camera pans around her apartment, sniggering. The woman can’t even keep it clean! it says. Her refrigerator is full of half-rotten food, and the teenager she’s babysitting complains of the smell when she opens it. Seriously? Much as i would like to identify with Warshawski, I’m sorry, that’s &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; fridge, not hers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathleen Turner isn’t bad. I find myself enjoying her unending sass. But she is not Warshawski. She is a sitcom character. If she could be transplanted into, say, “Designing Women” as some sort of yankee intrusion, she’d be great. Likewise, the teenaged sidekick she takes on is delightful at times, spewing even cruder, more shameless vitriol ("you're growing enough&amp;nbsp;penicillin&amp;nbsp;in this fridge to treat a case of the clap!"). But the girl in &lt;i&gt;Indemnity Only&lt;/i&gt; whose role this character was written to replace is not a jaded sassbucket. She is smart (hence Warshawski likes her), but she’s sweet, and for the most part, innocent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the moment when she asks Murray to stay with her in bed, he’s taken on the role of the man she dates in &lt;i&gt;Indemnity Only&lt;/i&gt;. Except the sentimental moment at the end of that story has him in a hospital bed saying he loves her, and her saying guiltily that she really &lt;i&gt;likes&lt;/i&gt; him. He says “you know it’s not the same thing,” and she gets teary-eyed at the truth of her ambivalence. Briefly. This romance with Murray, on the other hand, ends on a sweet note of mutually reciprocated affection. He’s on a stretcher, she holds his hand firmly, looks into his eyes, and melts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How deeply this film misunderstands her character lies in its choice of poles: from sarcasm to sentimentality. The former is of course present in her character--it’s part of what makes her fun to read--but in moderation rather than the whole of her voice. The latter she has hardly any of at all. This treatment of her as a shell of caustic wit protecting a gooey core buys into the popular and peculiar notion that underneath every misanthrope (which she’s not really) is a sweetheart, and that we’re “all the same on the inside,” i.e. full of the beautiful feeling that the proponents of this notion wish they had because it would secure their identity as Real People. Here her narrating voice has been erased entirely. Yes, in the novels she does wisecrack, especially to Bobby, but she is hardly a walking wisecrack. She does not have &lt;a href="http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/03/bananas-and-caramel.html"&gt;a mushy center, but a solid, cold one&lt;/a&gt;, which is part of what makes her a compelling narrator. She observes and reports calmly and clearly, with only a little nastiness. She is neither angsty nor cheery. This film has taken one aspect of her character--her sense of humor--and puffed it into the whole thing. Having done this, it is determined to pathologize and break down her unidimensionality. The tourist has taken a hundred snapshots of only the Eiffel Tower and has tweeted “Paris really needs something baroque--there’s nothing here but this bare steel tower.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a part of a charming montage of Warshawski training this teenaged girl of mysterious origins (honestly, I’m still not clear on whose daughter she is) who talks exactly like her, she teaches her how to manipulate men by acting dumb. Edified, the girl says “so, basically, to get what you want from a man you just treat him like a child.” Apparently “V.I. Warshawski”'s audience is men.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/09/vi-warshawski.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4676946103739306274'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4676946103739306274'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7J3aSawz1Pc/T4FpgFtflQI/AAAAAAAAETQ/B6Z4Nk8XfOk/s72-c/kathleen_turner_warshawski_desk.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-3497378492496804989</id><published>2013-09-12T15:06:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2013-09-12T15:13:04.747-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Cake is never for later.</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I boil the apples &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the sugar and butter. The peaches I throw on top of the caramel once it's done. They crackle and hiss like my fingers those times I accidentally grab hold of the skillet's handle without an oven mitt. My fear is if I cook the peaches like the apples, the peaches would release so much water that by the time they caramelized, they would become a sticky, undifferenciated goo. I suppose there's nothing wrong with jam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days later, the peach cake tastes like mildew. Normally, the whole thing gets eaten within twenty-four hours. This last 1/3 of the cake two mornings later is like stumbling on hidden treasure. I congratulate myself for my restraint, before I take a bite. It wasn't really restraint, anyway--I just didn't eat much cake. My apetite for it dimmed after I pulled it out of the oven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My friend is trying to stay away from gluten--&amp;quot;I've become one of those people&amp;quot;--but still has a mania for baking gluteny things. If anything, she bakes more when she doesn't eat the products. Dozens and dozens of cupcakes. &amp;quot;I like baking.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My father made turkey soup. &amp;quot;What should go in there? Potatoes, carrots, peppers, tomatoes, sour cream, cabbage?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mostly I just like the broth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now there's a massive pot of soup in the fridge, shiny and cold. I just stare at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My brother has developed a tamarind habit, which is another way of saying he bought some blocks of tamarind mass. &amp;quot;Mass&amp;quot; and not &amp;quot;paste&amp;quot; because you have to soak it in hot water, mash it with your fingers, and then strain out the husks and seeds. Maybe if it were at home I would never bother to make tamarind water (tamarind, water, sugar), but over at his house I love squishing the debris-filled muck. It's like playing in mud--something adults have generally decided they're above. Scatological comparisons are obvious, but, obviously, unwelcome if spoken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I make it concentrated, so that it can be diluted to taste, like Russian tea. My brother's girlfriend likes it very dilute--&amp;quot;refreshing.&amp;quot; He likes it fairly concentrated. I can't decide. Dilute, I drink glass after glass, because every swallow is unsatisfactory. Concentrated, I drink half a glass and leave it on the table. Its cloudy solids settle to the bottom. You'd think there would be a happy medium, but I haven't found it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are those things that I repeatedly vow never to eat again, like eggs on toast. Then I look in the fridge in the morning, and think what else am I going to make? There they are, greasy as ever. It would be reasonable to conclude that eggs on toast are, like anything else, something to have sometimes. But I only seem able to think in always and never.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/3497378492496804989/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/09/cake-is-never-for-later.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3497378492496804989'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3497378492496804989'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/09/cake-is-never-for-later.html' title='Cake is never for later.'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-7729604908161057451</id><published>2013-09-07T12:41:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2013-09-07T12:45:17.131-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Watery Cookies</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;The day before yesterday, it rained. Not an everyday occurance in summer, so the everyday shifted. In the middle of the day, my hair still shower-damp, dark clouds became something to plan for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some were very excited. They opened their windows to its smell and sound. At the same time, they hoped they wouldn't have to walk anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ran from the car to the coffee shop, and inside I gulped a few glasses of water. My shirt was well hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went to dinner with a friend. I decided it was a day for hot soup, but I also ordered iced green tea. I gulped at the tea, even though it didn't taste right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What's that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's odd.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She tried a sip. Neither of us could identify the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;May We Be Forgiven&lt;/em&gt; the secret to good (read: indestructible) cookies is a tablespoon of warm water. The narrator suspects his soul is made of brackish water. Having read him for the past three hundred pages, his suspicions seem well-founded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summer it's a pleasure to have hot coffee in the sun.

A man detective--where's the fun in that? It is at least an unabashedly political political murder mystery: In the first episode, it turns out the terrorist/murderer is a military man trying to convince the government that terrorism is a threat only the military can deal with. The show also isn't entirely on Wallander's side. It's a familiar hard-boiled bargain: he can have his moments of knowingness only if he's thrown off-balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this end, enter two women to confuse him: a new boss who he falls in love with, and a new officer who accuses him of running a boys club of an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You just don't want any women on your team, right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Maybe...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's what he is: a walking maybe. How else does one solve a murder? She ends up putting together much of the case, but both women tend to get lost in the background. They come, they give Kurt presumable inner turmoil, they leave. (His boss even lives tantalizingly next door, so that he can have a crisis every time he walks his dog.) Thus problematized, he goes forth to dominate the screen. The most satisfying moment for me was cutting back and forth between a pedophile staring at a group of children playing, and Kurt at his neighbor/boss/crush. Both are uncomfortably close to their desire; the pedophile's route home from his therapist passes by a playground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing populates such cramped psychological quarters as family, which is one reason the first series is better. It begins with his daughter, Linda, graduating the police academy. His very first scene undermines his fatherly authority. He's on the phone with Linda's mother, who is very amused with herself (how could you not be, when he's so serious?), poking fun at him as he packs to go to Linda's graduation the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Isn't it today?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You're drunk.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No more drunk than you are. I can see you with a glass of whiskey in your hand...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So can we. As the episode goes on, he seems drunker and drunker, though he isn't necessarily drinking. The graduation &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; the day Linda's mother thought it was, as he finds out the next day, when Linda shows up at the station in uniform. She is, of course, pissed that he didn't show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But it was a misunderstanding..!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike series two, in which it's Kurt supported by a host of characters, here the story is told in tandem: Kurt and Linda follow related but different trails. She has a life outside of police work. They fight, and their fights are thematically tangled up with the rest of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, she seems to tentatively forgive him for missing her graduation, kissing him on the cheek. Over the course of an episode thick with daughter-father drama, I find that hers is just the right perspective on him. He's pompus, and abstracted, and dense, yet can be endearing. It's a critical gaze that has a consequence of humanizing him. His limits are clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's so satisfying when she gets at an aspect of his demeanor that in the second series passes for stoical respect: &amp;quot;Look at you! You just stand there, blank-faced like a cold fish!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compare this anger toward the father's flaws to the downright scary relationship between daughter and father in &lt;em&gt;Alias&lt;/em&gt;. There, Sydney vacillates between near-religious love of him and the realization that he is her mortal enemy. Perhaps this has the ring of psychoanalytic truth, and it's convenient for a spy show whose basic move is the 180-degree reorientation of reality. (&lt;em&gt;Wallander&lt;/em&gt; is more concerned with revealing ugly prejudices through false moves.) The trouble is, Sydney's father always reserves the possibility of turning again. He's unknowable, irreducibly above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is there no Linda in series two? Because the actress, Johanna Sällström, comitted suicide. Cue a million blog posts reading her depression into every facial tic of her performance. I can't deny that I'm fascinated, but all I can really say is, one side effect of her death is we're left with a father run amok.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/09/kurt-wallander-exists-to-be-fucked-with.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3805339350518759653'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3805339350518759653'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-2265385994812154714</id><published>2013-09-01T00:45:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2013-09-01T00:49:05.563-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>Bipolar According to Silver Linings Playbook</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see &lt;em&gt;Silver Linings Playbook&lt;/em&gt; because I thought it might be about manic depression in some way. The trailer wasn't encouraging, but everyone said it was good. In other words, improving--to use Jeeves' only adjective for a book he's reading. It's fine, but it has nothing to do with mental illness. &amp;quot;Bipolar&amp;quot; is code for &amp;quot;quirky and inappropriate.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not impossible for manic depression to have some thematic resonance. &lt;em&gt;Homeland&lt;/em&gt; at least framed mania as a crisis of judgement. Carrie always seemed a bit nuts to her coworkers, but note that she was able to hide that she took medication for most of her career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we pretend &lt;em&gt;Silver Linings&lt;/em&gt; is about a bipolar man, his mania is never in the least bit sneaky. He seems to be always manic, yet the script seems to actually believe him when he says he's getting better. And this constant hyperoptimism (&amp;quot;silver lining&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;) and need to be doing shit is punctuated by &amp;quot;episodes&amp;quot; during which he wakes up his parents, yells about Hemmingway for the dumbest reason, and breaks things. I don't deny that this could happen, but watching the scene, you'd think mania is just a quirk, like not wearing underwear--not to everyone's taste, but with few serious repercussions. I guess this is an attempt to make it as much of cinematic spectacle as possible. I longed for Kay Redfield Jamison's narration of her manic explosions of thought. She convinces herself of her own genius in that state, of course, but she also might well be a genius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything for Pat is on the surface. The only character that seems to have any interiority at all is the depressive, Tiffany, and the romance plot becomes his quest for it. Which is not exactly a revelation. Likewise that the proof of true love is sexuality supressed for friendship until the right moment (the end, when the whole room is shocked by the sexuality of their dance moves, inexplicably).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if I want to believe the screenwriter isn't clueless, the only option as far as I can see is that it's a romance of two pathological liars who really like to be &amp;quot;weird,&amp;quot; and so self-diagnose themselves bipolar and nymphomaniac.

I would say “the women they love,” but in &lt;em&gt;Battlestar&lt;/em&gt; that would be redundant. All sex ends up being about the survival of one species or another, and although one of sex’s enthusiastic practitioners says that “love has nothing to do with sex,” it seems only to occur between man and woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then again, filial love is the strongest of all. Son weeps at father’s admission that he cares whether son lives or not. Mothers chase daughters across ship and dream, gorge their eyes out when torn away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only at the end do the show’s queen and princess in-spirit die, but from the beginning the men are haunted by dead women dear to them. One is a full-fledged character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a curious gender reversal of Dorothy Parker’s “Sentiment,” in which a woman melodramatically suffers through her memories of a man. In fits she realizes that many of her memories of him are probably counterfeits of her imagination. She wishes he were there to correct her imagination with his real presence, and then she imagines him there telling her “don’t sentimentalize.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlestar&lt;/em&gt;’s hauntings are vertiginous in a much nerdier sense: the question is not are they true, but what classification of thing are they? Is she a figment of his imagination, a chip in his brain, her spirit, God, something else? Fans of the show were reportedly disappointed by the finale not because it flattened all complexity, but because it didn’t reveal the real mechanics behind the show’s mysteries. There’s something especially funny about interrogating the clockwork of a universe populated with religious machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These apparitions are so generous. Conversations with absent people sounds like a perfectly serviceable definition of consciousness to me, but these are not the insinuations of those you only later recognize, but hallucinatory. Embodied solidly enough that you might find yourself being “fracked” by them. Poe would find it terribly poetical, which worries me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching some shows, I wish character’s minds weren’t so obscured. Watching &lt;em&gt;Battlestar&lt;/em&gt;, I find myself wishing my own experience of consciousness felt so unequivocal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, the aforementioned father, Adama, summons his dead wife. They chat. Actually it’s more fraught than that. Like a good feminine principle, she undermines all of his clear-cut rules. Hence she must be put to rest at the end of the day/episode. Ultimately, her purpose is to reinvigorate the moral ground on which he stands by taking it apart and slipping cleanly away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some entertaining fireworks--watch Baltar, whose interiority makes up about a quarter of the show, as his brows go from worried to unconsoleable--when these haunted men encounter the living women whose ghosts they banter with. It's especially upsetting to the drunk who sees his dead wife's face in the face of a Cylon woman he sees in the brig. (This show takes fantasy's role in love very literally.) She becomes pregnant and then, his wife returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This awfully intimate relationship with the deceased does not necessarily favor the living. When one man's wife dies, he remembers only what a dumbshit she was. Everything becomes to him a doomed, misguided fiction; he yells at Adama &amp;quot;you want to make a dead woman into an angel&amp;quot; and mocks &amp;quot;your precious ship.&amp;quot; The ship is the only thing keeping them alive, but he's right--their attachment to living is pretty funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show's tendency toward annihilation is perhaps its most pleasurable aspect. We go to blockbusters to confirm our lust for spectacular immortality (see e.g. &lt;em&gt;Elysium&lt;/em&gt; and every superhero movie). We watch television to bask in the reflection of our own desire for life to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An addiction to a lengthy serial drama has the happy effect of bringing life to a halt. It's no wonder that &lt;em&gt;Battlestar&lt;/em&gt;, whose addictiveness is on par with &lt;em&gt;Damages&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Buffy&lt;/em&gt;, allegorizes the viewer's dependency on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Galactica is on a journey to Earth, where humanity's struggles will end. I don't especially want them to find Earth; it would be the end of the show and I've have to step back out into the sunshine. The Cylons are the enemy and so a godsend (pun intended) for an addict: they keep making it very hard to arrive at the end of the story. Their constant interdictions are the lifeblood of the show's drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They find a shitty but hospitable planet before they find Earth. All the show's heroes don't want to stay there, but they do for a year (in the gap between seasons). Then the Cylons come back to conquer them. A relief! That planet was getting boring. It was even filmed in the drab colors of the everyday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And before they find the Earth they'd hoped for, they find a planet called Earth that's been nuked into oblivion. It's all wrong, but it's an omen of things to come because a verdant Earth means a nuked supply of episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An endearingly angry pilot named Starbuck is prophesied to lead them to Earth, and she hears through the Cylon grapevine &amp;quot;you will lead them to their end.&amp;quot; She's devastated by this. What's the contradiction?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her husband receives a bullet to the head, which is just short of lethal and gives him access to the memories of his past life--essentially, the backstory of the Cylons. It kills him to keep talking, but he's really excited about telling this story. The doctor has him wheeled away to remove the bullet and he screams at Starbuck: &amp;quot;don't take this away from me!&amp;quot; How can I not sympathize? Who wouldn't take a bullet to the brain for a tale?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they finally do arrive at Earth (shit), Adama's son has a crazy idea: he wants everyone to settle on the surface without any technology, just some provisions to get started. Baltar says &amp;quot;I'm surprised how amenable everyone is to this plan&amp;quot; and Adama, &amp;quot;never underestimate people's desire for a clean slate.&amp;quot; Given how this episode is taking shape, I couldn't agree more. Please, send the ships into the fucking sun. I never want to see another minute of this. The show exorcizes itself!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't have the newfound love of life that those who have neared death are rumored to gain, exactly. It's more of an aesthetic rejection of not-life. Which is exactly what the God(s) at the show's annoying Matrix-y close espouse regarding humanity. They think the 21st Century's technological renaissance (itself a questionable notion) is a sin that deserves a reboot of the species. I get the impression this is Ronald D. Moore's contention, too, which makes me want to ignore the nuance or at least ambiguity of the 60-some hours I watched. Moore apparently regards the entirety of human history as a fall from grace. Give me a break.

They are a fine thing, and are ruined by deliberation. It was delicious. Juicy, but not that pack of slimy weiners dripping from the fridge.

The fault is mine, of course, but is there a reason I was barred from choosing condiments at my leisure, free from the urgent surveilance of the waiter, however well-meaning? Why must I choose from these cute names under which condiments strain in nearly unreadable type? This may seem like a lot to ask, but I have one more question: Who puts coleslaw &lt;i&gt;on&lt;/i&gt; a hot dog?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other: 3/5&lt;/b&gt; Finding this faintly sad void where later barflies would gather, I evacuated to the sidewalk benches, which was a pleasant sit, despite adjacency to the wider, busier part of Hawthorne. The gaze drifts to tacos, just down the street, and &lt;a href="http://www.porquenotacos.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;¿por que no?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overall: 4/5&lt;/b&gt; When I ventured back inside to bus my empty basket, dear reader, a discovery! In my former haste, when I had feared the waiter's wary eye, I had missed the patio out the back door, where ping-pongers gaily swing their paddles in the sunshine--which in this blunt climate, even in the height of summer, withers. And as I departed, lo, I spied on the menu those words--nasty in form but welcome in significance--that I had suspected: "build your own."

(However, I don't mean to overstate how much people are like people.) Undoubtedly I have this image because one of these characters calls them &amp;quot;gladiators in suits&amp;quot;--the cheesiest line that ever was, as another acknowledges. Every character is remarkable and/or &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot; (and &amp;quot;weird is good&amp;quot;). Even their names seem ostenatiously legendary or fictional: Cyrus, Gideon, Pope, Huck. But greatness only lands on them like so many traumatic bricks; the rest they have to work at. The plane of infallibility is out of reach insofaras it is already within them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the writing begins with a bountiful antagonism reminiscent of Aaron Sorkin, it moves quickly toward forceful monologue. Olivia Pope executes takedowns not with elaborate ploys, as Gossip Girl's Blair Waldorf would, but with a single bomb of a speech made up on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyrus has the sarcastic version of her eloquence, and naturally becomes more her enemy throughout the course of the first season. There are reasons for this, but I'd like to entertain the possibility that Cyrus is untrustworthy simply because the mechanics, motives, and effects of his speech cannot be reconciled with Olivia's. Nobody really listens to him, so he is oblique. In one scene he tells the President how his life will be now that his dirty secret is out. He ends this acid prophecy with &amp;quot;but you just work on your speech, because that's important,&amp;quot; and a little chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olivia Pope is the clearest manifestation of greatness around. But if she were a stable element, it wouldn't be much of a show. The first episode reveals that her gut is never wrong and is wrong, that she doesn't believe in crying and cries. Yet this hadly diminishes our devotion, nor her employees. It seems to us that life's chaos can only be met with rash decision. Anything less is wallowing, or so we are convinced, watching her. With a little swallowed whine of discontent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her advice to her cohorts borders on patronizing aggression. She advises everyone to &amp;quot;get some normal,&amp;quot; while she herself freely admits &amp;quot;I'm not normal.&amp;quot; One of her worst moments is, to use the new employee's word, &amp;quot;demolishing&amp;quot; a girl who claims to have had sex with the president. And if she had not? For her, contemplation is done through action. Which is a fine thing for television. For someone who has made contemplation the only possible thing, it's also tempting, by way of sheer self-loathing, to say Olivia's knowledge through mistakes is the finest thing. Her attitude reminds me of a very defensive thing Michel Foucault wrote (if it were shorter, today it could be called a subtweet):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As to those for whom to work hard, to begin and begin again, to attempt and be mistaken, to go back and rework everything from top to bottom, and still find reason to hesitate from one step to the next--as to those, in short, for whom to work in the midst of uncertainty and apprehension is tantamount to failure, all I can say is that clearly we are not from the same planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's at once inspiring and arrogant. He defends analytic thought from contemplative paralysis, which is nearly tantamount to giving himself a free pass to analyze whatever and however he wants. Olivia Pope means to move herself and everyone around her into such great motion that nobody will ever be stuck or lost (&amp;quot;giving up is not an option&amp;quot;), and her noble cause gives her justification to destroy or manipulate whoever stands in her way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, Olivia Pope is not from the same planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being from a different planet can inspire respect as much as it can eros. A funny thing, for her--she's mostly indifferent to it. But she does have desire. The president's romantic gesture is to ask her for &amp;quot;just one minute.&amp;quot; Taking one minute to stand staring into each other's eyes could not be more alien to her nature. Inaction being under such a foreceful prohibition, perhaps for her it's better than sex. They do have sex, but annoying as it is to watch two people look into each other's eyes for this long, surely it's the pause that's apotheotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She trusts him; she hates how her trust blinds her. She loves him; she's at war with him. Lucy Snowe (&lt;em&gt;Villette&lt;/em&gt;) says it best:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reader, if in the course of this work, you find that my opinion of Dr. John undergoes modification, excuse the seeming inconsistency. I give the feeling as at the time I felt it; I describe the view of character as it appeared when discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's best not to think in terms of opinion. Yet it is so often solicited. The &amp;quot;gladiators&amp;quot; have a ritual of observing their clients from behind glass, before they take them on, but Olivia has always already decided. They're supposed to vote whether they believe the client's story, but the vote never matters. Why do this? Why have a minute of looking into each other's eyes? Any show with a bit of self-respect (or maybe vanity) is more interested in the eyes averted, glancing, or spying. Oddly, the cynical view of characters with cynical gazes gives a clearer picture, while &lt;em&gt;Scandal&lt;/em&gt;'s direct and sustained eye contact (tearing people apart, too, is done face-to-face) makes character more difficult to gauge. There is no one-way glass. The potential clients know they're being observed. In these open conditions Olivia sees clearly the &amp;quot;character as it appeared when discovered,&amp;quot; while everyone, including us, are busy trying to get to the bottom of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the show is so counter-voyeuristic, why this love of bevelled windows? At nearly every opportunity, the camera pans slowly across the edge, yielding a rainbow-tinged double of whoever's there that's always slipping in or out. It seems incongruous that the barrier of the window is necessary to introduce this nagging visual error. In the world of the show, all that is necessary is to pull down all barriers, and one senses a lie crawling away.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/8683601570816387683/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/07/papal-infallibility.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8683601570816387683'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8683601570816387683'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/07/papal-infallibility.html' title='Papal Infallibility'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-696119251746789966</id><published>2013-07-03T15:38:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2013-07-05T18:42:32.525-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Variety</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Apparently, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/fieldnotes/2013/05/03/why-astronauts-need-good-noses/#.UdDAPpwmzlU"&gt;astronauts suffer from &amp;quot;food boredom,&amp;quot; or are hypothesised to&lt;/a&gt;. I like the idea that someone could die from lack of variety, but only because it assumes the importance of the kind of thing often thought of today as not real. The other hypothesis given sounds more like science fiction: &amp;quot;their sense of smell changes as microgravity shifts fluids around in their heads.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm entertained by this inversion of credibility, but I think the food boredom hypothesis is believable becauses the need for variety is already pervasive. I would say it's not usually matter of life or death, but in the sense of wasted life or the nonlife implied by expressions such as &amp;quot;you're not really living,&amp;quot; it is. If you live in an abundance of variety of food, eating the same thing is a little death. It is as if we try to live life in imitation of our market's plethora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a chicken-and-egg problem in this life of variety, especially if you cook for yourself. I often say I'm in a rut. It's a kind of trench warfare--all the action happens on the brief, perilous run to the next rut. At all other times the rut leads back to the rut: Making and eating repetitive food dulls the spirit, and you need to be in high spirits to even think of cooking something outside whatever rut you're in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's something bizarre about feeling one must always be consuming something novel. After all, the most ritualistic foods are often great pleasures. Okay, that would just be coffee and tea, for me. I know someone, though, who decided she didn't need coffee, she just needed the ritual, and began making smoothies in the morning. It doesn't matter that the preparation literally never changes, just that it solidifies into a ritual, and that it continues to convince you of its efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efficacy is the thing, isn't it? We rush from one &amp;quot;ethnic&amp;quot; restaurant to the next because we imagine it will have more oomph than the last. We travel around the world (our own place is not a part of this world, of course) in hopes that life elsewhere is more intense than it is where we are. Travel snapshots look best with impossibly high color saturation. Memory can be sanctified if never revisited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MFK Fisher once quarrelled with her then husband over this. He refused &amp;quot;to back to a place where once he had been happy.&amp;quot; (The place was a town in France, unshockingly.) He thought it was &amp;quot;foolish to try to recapture happiness.&amp;quot; She &amp;quot;wasn't trying to recapture anything.&amp;quot; The two come to an equitable solution, of sorts. He can have his precious memory; she went back with her sister and had a lovely time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't a matter of knowledge versus happiness. Fisher didn't go back with the intent of ruining a beloved thing by revealing its underbelly--the investagatory renunciation of pleasure that academics (and I) get off on. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; foolish to try to make the same cup of coffee another morning. The coffee wasn't what was good. This doesn't mean one shouldn't try to make another good cup of coffee, perhaps even the same way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/696119251746789966/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/07/variety.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/696119251746789966'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/696119251746789966'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/07/variety.html' title='Variety'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-1187286638979008312</id><published>2013-07-01T14:12:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2013-07-18T21:49:28.064-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Tattoos</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;The fake concern I always hear from the untattooed is permanence. The nightmare scenario is some youthful, fleeting aspect preserved forever on the body. The implied corollary is that one should only permanently mark oneself with that which is permanent in oneself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is different from &lt;em&gt;Spider Lilies&lt;/em&gt;' concern with true tattoos, which do not have to be selfsame with their bearer, but rather must do some substantial work on her. Takeko is an artful cyberneticist, seeking not to bolster the self by risking it, but to create something new and true by augmentative artifice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fear I speak of, on the other hand, issues from the idea of a self before and outside of marks, best preserved by remaining unmarked by anything alien to it. This self is inside, and is degraded if it does not show itself outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I may not be the person to say anything about tattoos: My view is not tempered by me being its object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it seems strange that my attention is drawn to tattoos, it cannot help but be. There are a lot of tattoos in southeast Portland. Half-concealed under pointedly casual clothing, their presence seems far more important than their artistry or import. This is of course in part because I don't pay all that much attention to their shapes and colors. Nonetheless, especially considering how the tattooed flock together (can this be called a mural?), tattoos for this crowd seems more a practice of selfhood, a lifestyle, its philosophy the opposite of those who worry about being stuck with an unworthy tattoo. That philosophy, it must be said, is basically YOLO. The self is thought to intensify by marking it with whims. Life is not wasted in pursuing desires that won't last. That, and only that, is properly life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both attitudes are two sides of the same sociological coin. One seeks to distance itself from the perceived markers of the lower class, indeed, to adopt distance as its overarching style. A strategy to give the impression of commanding eternity. The other--my millennial peers of Belmont and Hawthorne--frenzies to consume experiences below their means. Destabilization must be sought out because it can never be found, because it is never sought earnestly. One may pickle in cheap beer, cigarettes, cover oneself in tattoos decided upon at three in the morning. One will not be relieved of oneself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predictably, all I can really think when I see a tattoo is how fragile its medium. What difference, good or bad, lively or destructive, does loading that canvas with signs make? In the university library in Ashland there's a painting entitled &amp;quot;Marks Not Knowing Why.&amp;quot; I do not know why it should have been painted, nor do I know why it should not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course this position of mine is ridiculous, and far too neat. There. Did you see that? It bloats when it strikes itself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/07/tattoos.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1187286638979008312'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1187286638979008312'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-7929402710348500342</id><published>2013-06-07T17:38:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2013-06-07T17:38:23.378-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Kitchens</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;In college I only learned that it's dreadful for a stranger to live in your kitchen. And this only at the very end. I was never much concerned with kitchens. I had no need to be. Like the socks my parents always gifted me for Christmas, most of the necessary implements and space were just always around. When landlords rent to summer vacationers and students, the kitchens are never quite empty. In houses in small towns, kitchens are rarely cramped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took moving to an apartment (a word that became more ghastly with every week I lived in one) to realize how lovely the kitchen of my childhood and current home is. Not because it has the latest doodads, but because cooking there doesn't feel like a perversion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between a house on a hill and a shoebox of a converted hotel room, I became an aesthete of kitchens. Oddly, the top and bottom of this relief were built in the same year, 1905. But where the house's kitchen has always been the kitchen, the apartment's kitchen was added in 2003 in a slobbery effort to turn a dilapidated building into rent revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the windows are eyes, the apartment's kitchen is hidden in the dark. The fact that it's as far away as it can be from the windows, and only connected by a narrow doorway, gives the hot air it generates the longest, most arduous escape. There's a fan, but it doesn't do much. To cook there is to steam in my own cooking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The excreta of cooking is all close enough to touch. I must be vigilant in cleaning, and prepare ingredients in just the right sequence, because there's only enough counter for one cutting board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all of its visual obscurity, the sounds of cooking can be heard by all. If I can hear my neighbors watching a movie, or the incomprehensible mumble of their conversations, they must be able to hear me whipping cream in a metal bowl at one in the morning. That's the thing about an apartment--it's apartness is shouted for all to hear. Tolerance belies antagonism, and an apartment is specified amidst intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything in the pantry I bought for myself. While at home I grumble about having to put up with other's neuroses, in an apartment all to myself there is nothing but my own neuroses. It's nice not to encounter someone else's dessicated oatmeal or molding bread, but it's needful to find ingredients I didn't think I wanted. Despite and because I hate excess, I take pleasure in making something out of my father's neglected, nearly-rotten vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At home, the kitchen is porous. Light comes in the windows, air flows. The counters are usually a mess, but they can be cleaned if I need more room. With space and food going to waste, I'm not intensely aware of time passing. It's not a pod in which to carry out the necessary task of making something to eat, but a place to do whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By aesthete I really mean I admire and am jealous of kitchens. Like yards, they seem of a better life. Not every kitchen, of course. But sometimes my eyes grow wide and I say &amp;quot;what wonderful light.&amp;quot; And then they tell me about their plumbing problems, their mice, or how the height of their sink has given them chronic spinal pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/7929402710348500342/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/06/kitchens.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7929402710348500342'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7929402710348500342'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/06/kitchens.html' title='Kitchens'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4466431751920364509</id><published>2013-06-06T00:03:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2013-06-06T10:45:59.771-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Cherry Preserves</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;For all its sugar, according to its packaging, jam needs to be refrigerated. A fridge collects of all those things that would otherwise spoil. It puts side by side items that would otherwise have nothing to do with one another. You may object that food has to be stored somewhere, next to something. The fridge is not remarkable in this way. True, but what it brings together is particular to refrigeration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another property not at all unique to the fridge is its extension beyond the practical need it fulfills. Some things go into the fridge not because they'd go bad otherwise, but because they go in the fridge. I want to say there's paranoia in storing eggs in the fridge, but that hinges on the &amp;quot;rationality&amp;quot; of leaving eggs out. Gross. I'll keep that for later. Or maybe for never. An uncanny consequence of having a receptacle of instant preservation is that more ends up going in than gets used. Cleaning out a fridge is an archeology of desires never acted on. Or more often, incompletely consumed. At some point they go bad, and even if they haven't, ancient jars are easily shunned for the &lt;em&gt;possibility&lt;/em&gt; they might be spoiled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going in the opposite direction, the taste of cherries is smelled more than tasted, and anticipated more than smelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trouble with the essay is its preoccupation with putting things together in sequence. One comment about refrigeration becomes a thesis, which is a kind of smell. If I say, for example, that sometimes I think there are no thoughts, only images, I must insist upon why this is relevant. Of course, you could say that my trouble with the essay is my insistence on turning it into a fridge. Rather than a thesis I have a theme, overextending into everything that happens to fall under my preoccupations. Then again, who is to say my preoccupations are unrelated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not necessarily related, a 92-year-old man tells me that his life's stories, between them, have everything. &amp;quot;Everything's in there,&amp;quot; he says. He thinks his job as a typewriter repairman in New York extended into every cranny of life. &amp;quot;There are over 200 stories in there,&amp;quot; he says, patting his tome. If his life is his job, as he says, then his job is also as he says--a survey of every form of life, or at least every job. That made use of a typewriter. His book at once has demographic ambitions and is contained by a peculiar circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also tells his life as an ideal example of the universal possibility of the American dream. He began impoverished; now he's comfortably retired in the city of retirement. The way he claims himself as an example is, of course, an awfully exemplary example of a common idea. Is the idea of his life as a proof of an idea related to his life? In one of his stories, the woman he later marries calls him a crook, because instead of going to dinner he goes to repair a typewriter. The joke is, as it is in situation comedy, that he's a victim of circumstance, not a crook. He's not much of a crook, but the name &amp;quot;the crook&amp;quot; stuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the same with lemons. You know what I mean? You can't really intend something to be uncalculated, can you. Even absolutely nothing can insinuate itself. Forget essays, this is the trouble with being awake--everything has to be related! If late at night in the dark you happen to be thinking of haunting, it's hard for any subsequent screaming not to be related. I thought I heard the screamer scream &amp;quot;WHO'S THERE?!&amp;quot; but surely not. I'm not convinced that doubt isn't a kind of faith. Obviously the noises following the screaming, of rustling and clanging and thumping and creaking were the noises of other doubters waking up, and walking down the hall to investigate. Everything turned quiet soon, but I kept the lights on until it got light out, and only then slept. It's not that in sleep nothing is related, but is relation even a question? What goes in a dream journal without the idea that dreams mean something?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the life story of a successful young entrepreneur without his belief in the positive effect of a positive outlook? What else might've brought together these incidents? With his girlfriend &amp;amp; business partner he traveled across country, sleeping in the car, washing in university bathrooms. It can't be a coincidence that his business is &lt;em&gt;gift wrapping&lt;/em&gt;.

Every time I walked around in shoes I thought &amp;quot;I really need to clip my toenails,&amp;quot; because the nails jammed into the toes, which hurt. Then one day I did it! I don't know where the motivation came from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went to meet someone, and she said &amp;quot;you should really clip your fingernails, they're getting out of hand.&amp;quot; I don't sleep with this person, but I was proud of the fact that I would not scratch someone in my sleep with my toenails, even though I had not been. I thought she would be pleased, even though she couldn't see my toenails. She just kept reminding me to clip my fingernails! I mean, politely, but still I almost took off my shoes and socks to show her what I had been up to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There we were, eating chips on his floor. I'm sorry, I lied earlier. I thought it would sound better if he were a she, for some reason. Probably sounded worse. Anyway, I don't think his grooming advice was meant maliciously, because he was very friendly otherwise. &amp;quot;We should get high, dude,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said, &amp;quot;your floor is really dirty.&amp;quot; In my defense, I really didn't want to get high. Or maybe I did, so I really didn't. Semantics, I guess. He didn't seem to hear me, because he was eating the chips really sloppily, getting crumbs all over the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can't really remember if we talked about life or played video games. I was too preoccupied. I couldn't figure out if I had a right to be angry or not. Besides, I was really quite happy, despite being uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, he was quite a chip connisseur. He told me about the factory these chips came from, and how they are made. He had been there once, on a chip tour. The workers were really quite well payed, with lots of benefits, he said. We could feel good about eating them. The Tostitos nacho dip was the ideal pairing for this chip, he said. I was engrossed by all this. I began not to care about how ruthlessly he had judged my fingernails. He had picked out the right dip for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was late by then, and I didn't want to walk several miles home. &amp;quot;You don't mind sleeping on the floor, do you?&amp;quot; he asked. &amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; I said, chips &amp;amp; dip already dancing in my head, and possibly my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the morning, I looked at his toenails. They looked like mine did before I clipped them, except without the layer of fungus. He rolled over. His eyes were closed, but I could tell he was awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can I borrow your sandals?&amp;quot; I asked. He squinted. &amp;quot;Okay, but shouldn't we eat breakfast?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Oh, yes! Absolutely. Never mind about the sandals.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After breakfast I scraped the crumbs off my feet, and put on my socks and shoes. As I was going out the door he called after me &amp;quot;really do something about those fingernails!&amp;quot; in a kind of loving tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A month later, I bought sandals. I left the store wearing them. The sun was out, so I walked to a park where children screamed and splashed in a shallow water fountain. I felt there was something strange about a giant fountain designed for children to play in. Someone later told me it's called a &amp;quot;water park.&amp;quot; Every time I stopped admiring my sandals and opened a book, I got a whiff of sewage. I looked around at the other people basking in the sun reading hefty books or simply looking at the children playing and burping. Did they smell what I smelled?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was determined to read just one more short story, but the smell kept nagging. More annoying than the smell, of course, was my inability to ignore it. I walked two blocks to another park, where I nestled low in the reeds, away from the wind. The day and the horizon, now obscured by cheerful vegetation, seemed to become the same thing. I was content. I ate a cookie. I felt I might pass out or throw up at any moment. I don't mind vomit so much; it's the feeling that I'll stop being me. I looked down at my toes. The nails were long and scaly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting on my shoes, I saw a bus that was headed to where I lived. I got on with one lace untied. At the next stop, a man sprinted nearly three blocks to get on the bus. He was panting, but I envied him. Then a troop of children got on, who I recognized from the water park. They were all eating ice cream. I expected the ice cream to drip from their cones onto the floor, but they seemed to be expert at licking their cones to prevent this. It smelled like strawberry flavoring on the bus. More nausea. This time, I felt the absence of blood all over. I felt like I was dying. That's what it is, when you stop being you. I almost texted a friend &amp;quot;I'm dying!&amp;quot; But as I was about to hit send, the feeling passed. Then it returned, and passed again, and so on. I thought that if I sent the text, I would no longer feel this way. Because I didn't send it, I imagined myself collapsing as I got off the bus. Someone would come look after me. Maybe they'd carry me back to my apartment. Maybe they'd take me to the hospital. Maybe they would see my now immaculate fingernails. Or maybe they'd just assume I was a homeless drunk! I became determined to stay conscious until I got home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I exited the bus, my shoe fell off. I was embarassed, so I didn't tell the driver, and consequently didn't have time to pick up my shoe. I put my sandals back on. The chip conisseur was knocking on the door to my apartment. &amp;quot;Oh hey,&amp;quot; he said, looking down at my feet. &amp;quot;My god! Your toenails are monsters!&amp;quot; I couldn't think of anything to say, so I unlocked the door and gingerly got into bed. He came in looking cheerful. &amp;quot;You okay?&amp;quot; Then he pulled a shiny pair of metal clippers from his bag. &amp;quot;Look what I brought!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/7988786872141025147/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/06/nails.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7988786872141025147'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7988786872141025147'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/06/nails.html' title='Nails'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-2100464262018170115</id><published>2013-06-01T01:12:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2013-06-01T01:12:59.451-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'></content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2100464262018170115'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2100464262018170115'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-2142654704659685983</id><published>2013-05-31T21:00:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2013-05-31T21:00:32.778-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Raw Food</title><content type='html'>coffee poured over strawberries  tomatoes and bacon   </content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/05/raw-food.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2142654704659685983'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2142654704659685983'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-6043703781214116259</id><published>2013-05-30T21:06:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2013-05-30T21:06:53.890-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The End of the World</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;He's cute, but keeps his distance. He's careful never to propose anything that could be agreed with. Her hand on his is wrong, but necessary. &amp;quot;Are you hurt?&amp;quot; He looks hurt by the notion that he's hurt. &amp;quot;Frustrated?&amp;quot; He takes incommensurability to be evidence of his genius. A little singularity, words spinning off, not meant to be understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can't blame her for disagreeing with his inwardness turned outward, but she does. At least outwardly. Apologies and laughter twitch. She's sorry for telling him &amp;quot;you have this line, that we're all doomed.&amp;quot; Sorry because correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you met either one of them on the street you wouldn't know it. Their faces are obscure, even from three feet away--peripheral, even straight-on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just their voices, and clouds with no brakes. Easy to tell in the rustlings of leaves the difference between a nice breeze and a storm. They argue about population control and resource shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, vision can fail. An eyelid can flutter involuntarily. What does disrupted vision look like? Anything?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's hungry for himself, but after so long wandering with the pressure of emptiness in his belly, hunger has become nausea. If he got a chance to dig in, he'd have to take little bites. The meal would be too rich. It wouldn't make him more solid, but less. Eating himself ought to leave him about the same, but some would be lost in digestion. By the time he ate all of himself there'd be a lot of waste, and someone would have to clean it up. Probably that dogooder of a girlfriend. Isn't it her fault he gets white in the face whenever he has thoughts of self-actualization?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though she seems unconcerned by what he says (more amused by what he says and concerned for him), privately she's somewhat of a megalomaniac. There's no bloodflow to show for it, but her retrospective shame makes her shout. All the wrong things she says to him! She can never remember what he says. She remembers attending closely to what he says, but his words are lost. Perhaps, she sometimes reflects, the shame of her selective memory accounts for her enthusiasm for listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all their verbal discord, they're well-coordinated. In silence they slip into the back room. They prepare to leave, circling and brushing past each other in nearly identical backpacks. They're ostentatiously sly. The darker clouds are overtaking, maybe speeding away. Everyone is wondering will it rain? Trying to ignore these two pivoting on the linolium. They leave the door to the back room ajar.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6043703781214116259/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/05/the-end-of-world.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6043703781214116259'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6043703781214116259'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/05/the-end-of-world.html' title='The End of the World'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4112892546174894811</id><published>2013-05-26T15:36:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2013-05-26T17:39:00.305-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Crying</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;The baby is crying. &amp;quot;I know, honey,&amp;quot; her mother coos, and rolls the stroller gently back and forth. Seeing her across the cafe, the deaf man is troubled by the privacy of her pain. &amp;quot;You can't walk around, honey, it's too dangerous,&amp;quot; she tells the baby, though she appears to address the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What took you so long?&amp;quot; she asks her husband as he sits down. He says the baby wants to get out of the stroller. He lifts her out, and when he sets her down she begins crying again. &amp;quot;You just got out, and now you're angry again?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind him, a girl is saying to a boy &amp;quot;no, you really can't understand.&amp;quot; They're wearing identical black jackets. She leaves (in a huff, he thinks) to get their drinks, and when she returns there's a whining dog in her way. &amp;quot;It's okay, it can't reach you,&amp;quot; he says, and she slips past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That poor dog,&amp;quot; says the husband, &amp;quot;he's been waiting for his owner for so long.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;He's a she,&amp;quot; says the wife, &amp;quot;and her owner's just inside. She's just a whiny dog.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The baby starts toddling over to the dog, and hits her head on a chair. The deaf man reflects how poorly the world is made for babies. The baby's parents are amazed how often the baby runs into things. The baby reaches the dog. Still whinng, the dog doesn't see her. Her mother picks her up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner comes out to the dog and holds her head in place. &amp;quot;Sit,&amp;quot; he says, &amp;quot;stay.&amp;quot; As soon as he goes back inside, the dog strains her leash towards him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another man comes in with another dog. &amp;quot;My dog is ridiculously well-trained,&amp;quot; he tells his friend. &amp;quot;His training cost as much as a new car.

Inevitably, it wasn't much of one. Some people are prone to this stupidity. When I got to the trail, this gaggle of mountainbikers was rolling about like there was nobody in the world but them. Two of them were at the edge of the trail, actually considering going down the cliff. &amp;quot;That's just one of those things, you know, you've just got to go for it.&amp;quot; I found myself preoccupied with crashing through the ferns and brush, a stick going between the spokes, and ending up Wile E. Coyoted in the creek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ashland I discovered I missed the small-town, middle-class projection of calm. Walking down residential streets in the sunshine I feel so wonderfully obscure. It's a hipsterdom of neighborhoods. I flatter myself that I don't belong in Ashland's seemingly monolithic community. A far more comforting feeling of outsiderness than skirting the city's plethora of imminent scenes, cliques, and classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day I told my friends &amp;quot;I think a spider bit me!&amp;quot; I didn't think a spider bit me. But who knows? My cheek felt red, or white--stung, or numb. Did they notice anything, driving off in their minivan? The kids kicking their skateboards up the hill would've made an effort not to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail--not quite a trail, going up a small stream overhung with bushes--was a last ditch obscurity. When did I start asking myself &lt;em&gt;what are you doing?&lt;/em&gt; At the beginning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt my cheek. There wasn't anything on it, but my fingers came away perfumed. Maybe it was just the raspberries doing what they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is stupid. This is the stupidest thing you've ever done. Well, not the stupidest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mirror there was nothing. Disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It's getting dark. Oh my god, You're going to be stuck out here in the mud in the dark!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because I couldn't (&lt;em&gt;you should really&lt;/em&gt;) turn around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because I wanted to get over the ridge and look at the sunset. Something I didn't believe was feasible even when I began, an hour before dark. That must be why I went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously it didn't turn dark, either. In Ashland I went up to the dam that stores the town's water. It looked fragile. It occured to me that if the dam broke, it would be a tsunami in a canyon. It would destroy downtown. I felt a shiver, but titilation doesn't make things happen any more than willpower.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/2531610971133522458/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/05/meep-meep.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2531610971133522458'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2531610971133522458'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/05/meep-meep.html' title='Meep Meep'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-5117625896297135593</id><published>2013-05-11T11:09:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2013-05-11T11:18:21.074-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>Good Interests</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Last year, when he wasn't trying to emote from underneath several inches of wrinkley latex, Guy Pearce gave the biggest TED talk ever. It was a dytopian future of TED: on a tiny stage in a stadium, an entrepreneur peddled his &amp;quot;idea worth spreading&amp;quot; with grave tones and allusions to Greek mythology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now he pitches the idea that human DNA &amp;quot;is destined for an upgrade,&amp;quot; shows off a room-sized hologram of his brain, and says things like &amp;quot;the next iteration.&amp;quot; He drops &amp;quot;mimesis&amp;quot; and preens, as if this word alone just solved the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These touches are of course intended to set him apart in sliminess. Robert Downey Jr.'s problem is that he came from the same slime. Back when he was a part of the &amp;quot;party scene,&amp;quot; he said &amp;quot;you've basically hacked DNA!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has anxiety attacks because &amp;quot;nothing's been the same since New York,&amp;quot; apparently not alluding to 2001. He confides to Gwyneth Paltrow, &amp;quot;I experience things, and then they're over.&amp;quot; Yet he's not relieved when the fake terrorist  interrupts a TV broadcast (again) to tell the world &amp;quot;don't worry, the final lesson is coming&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doomsday didn't deliver, but the DNA-hack he was so excited about offers a kind of solution for his malaise. He can't sleep, and all of his activity is side-stepping &amp;quot;tinkering.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Him being a man, confessing these problems to his mother-accountant-wife, Paltrow, is a Big Gesture. Not only does his small admission of vulnerability nullify their disagreements, it earns him a big cookie, like a baby who finally pooed in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, for him, time doesn't really pass. &amp;quot;Extremis&amp;quot; punctuates by exploding people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it was him who ended up in the spotlight, it was the slimy idea-slinger around whom a network organized. But the whole thing gets a bit too hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how Downey Jr. describes Extremis: &amp;quot;You know when a girl's straddling you and she glows from the inside, kind of orange?&amp;quot; The troubling substance is emphatically tied up with an interrupted sexual encounter. His innuendo-y puns leading up to the inventor's bedroom and his insistence on her bedroom are relentless. When the stuff blows up in the next room, an even more blatant visual joke lands on top of him in the form of his concerned body guard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For being immortal, the Extremis-ists are awfully precarious. Extremis doesn't always &amp;quot;take&amp;quot;, and explodes you instead. Pearce insists on a rhetoric of purification, and the film insists that the Extremis makes one more oneself, contrasting bare bodies with metal suits. For all their bare drive, they're oddly decentered, their rengerative and destructive power emanating from Extremis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hero and the villain compete at first for Petter Pots' interest. Hence Pearce's schmoozey holopowerpoint in her office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Pearce was busy getting connected, Downey Jr. isolated himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Hall describes the process of becoming interested: &amp;quot;first you're all wide-eyed, then...[you get compromised]&amp;quot;. Being a scientist is for her an accumulation of compromises. Yet the thing her compromises unleashed, Extremis, is a reversal of wonder cooling into scientific interest. Rather than being in between anything, you are the thing. Your body generates enough heat to melt things. Extremis is a nightmare of overconnectedness. A destructive rather than productive network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morality in this movie is a matter of how to manage your interests. The hero is preoccupied with how his hobby is more like an addiction, taking him away from his relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he says he's renouncing his &amp;quot;cocoon&amp;quot; of hobbies, he's towing the burnt remnants of his workshop. Is it possible to read his self-reinvention as anything other than the very fantasy that draws him back to the workshop? His whole life was organized around the energy-producing contraption which made time stand still near his heart, to keep a piece of shrapnel from penetrating it. He's repaired his damaged heart, and renounced his distracting shell. Can anyone survive on only what they ought to be?&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/5117625896297135593/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/05/good-interests.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/5117625896297135593'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/5117625896297135593'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/05/good-interests.html' title='Good Interests'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-6996197774855552529</id><published>2013-05-03T00:23:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2013-05-16T16:21:12.631-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='There Is Only Memoir'/><title type='text'>Subjects</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We uh filled it in with uh some uh fill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh no, I like &lt;em&gt;popcorn&lt;/em&gt;.

It probably gives Evegeny Morozov hives and/or an erection (a critic's diptich of conditions). The same cake is on the stove as four months ago, on another stove. I persist writing mood pieces about cakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt; ever changed the way it does what it does? I doubt it. It's just intensified. These days it's a series of Mad Men Moments and setups for Mad Men Moments. Is it slapstick? Arrange things so that characters stumble into saying something unwittingly wise or prophetic. Last episode, the poetic phrase (and image) was &amp;quot;Why are you being punished?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Because the wallpaper doesn't line up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like a Don line, but this MMM belongs to his son, and suddenly he loves him. He says so to Megan, and she hugs him because oh my god, a man is having an Emotional Experience. (Much like the show's spectacle of whites spectacularly emoting over MLK's death. I'll give you one guess what two colors the wallpaper was.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don is more interested in his son's emergent familiarity than how he might be different. The show couldn't care less about its subject, only that it's poetic. Don is in love with himself, and the show is in love with itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do I care if I make new cakes? This one's delicious. Are there fruit other than apples?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, MMMs were delicious. They sustained interest. (A much messier word.) I'm always trying to decipher what made one meal delicious and another unremarkable. Odd--delight in eating is a terrible index of delight in anything else. My latest theory is to eat well is to take interest. A meal of variety is exemplary (there's always one), but even a lone bowl of broth may hold interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest is as suspect to &lt;em&gt;Rectify&lt;/em&gt; as thought is heroic. One of the first things Daniel says in public is that in prison he developed a routine intended to avoid thinking. When he wasn't trying to stamp out thinking with chants, he read books, and thoughtfully conversed with the man in the next cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His half-brother, Ted, is calculated to make us as uncomfortable as Daniel, suspected of rape and murder, makes everyone on the show. Ted's problem is that he's as thoughtless as he is self-interested. He distrusts Daniel because he assumes Daniel will take his job. He thinks Daniel is guilty because Daniel tells him about being raped in prison. Presumably, he feels raped by Daniel's story. That's his epistemology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Never seen so many dumb Georgia crackers descended upon egg rolls and sweet and sour chicken in your life,&amp;quot; Ted says. &amp;quot;That's interesting,&amp;quot; Daniel says. &amp;quot;I guess.&amp;quot; Ted has too much interest to find anything interesting. Daniel finds everything interesting and tries self-flagellatingly hard to not be interested in himself. This impersonality embues him and his thinking with an aura of goodness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verlyn Klinkenborg posits interest to be a way of bargaining with abudance. Being interested is the thing he urges us to recover from underneath our education. The bargain he proposes is: trust in the abundance of your interest, and receive the abundance of your interest. If I say I'm not sure about this, he can say that's why. I'm not sure whose circular logic it is, but still, I'm not sure. I'm the sort of person who can be engrossed by a novel for hundreds of pages and never read the last fifty. (Or reverse those numbers.) I routinely commit Klinkenborg's sin of being anxious I'll lose interest in a piece of writing. Not because the piece is a terrible idea, not ultimately worthy of interest, but because I'll make cake, watch television, worry about those things that impetuously solicit worry. Thinking that I'll think about something in the future is pretty much meaningless. My calendar and to-do list are records of futile promises. This is so apparent that, like Alison Bechdel repeats &amp;quot;I think&amp;quot; in her diary, I append question marks to half of my tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, they're &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; terrible ideas. Given enough time to mull over anything, I'll come to the conclusion it's stupid. (Which, yes, is a stupid conclusion, but what can I do?) We would have nothing if this logic reigned. Robert Creeley's introductions to his own collections of work are graceful for letting their contents be. But they would never have been written if he always took the long view. Creation is a process of outrunning understanding, for me at least, I think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is stupid. What's wrong with making a cake I'm not infatuated with? Klinkenborg critiques the notion of writerly genius, in which all writing comes in flashes and unstoppable flows. Because his is a self-help book and everything has to be about doing better, the problem with needing to be infatuated with what you're doing is that it's deterimental to doing. It's also a reaction to the danger of fantasy, to being in hot, precarious relation. Interest appears as an appealing alternative to infatuation because it's cooler, more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are relations other than detached tepidness and compromising intimacy. I know that I placed those adjectives to show their misplacement, but the motive is dim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's that about cake?&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/269401862030452784/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/04/the-men-in-my-mind-in-theirs-too.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/269401862030452784'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/269401862030452784'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/04/the-men-in-my-mind-in-theirs-too.html' title='The Men In My Mind (In Theirs, Too)'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-63202781291242405</id><published>2013-04-24T00:10:00.004-07:00</published><updated>2013-05-16T16:21:12.630-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='There Is Only Memoir'/><title type='text'>Observations on Nothing in Particular</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;At a certain age, yelling is not loud. It's a nonvolume. Not at all certain that these sounds reach anyone. Not even certain that the sounds are sounds, but uncertainty implies thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If painted pearl, cars can reflect so much sunlight that they're very difficult to see, except insofaras the points at which they blind you are abundantly apparent. If you're moving, or these cars are moving, their self-dazzlement is a reminder of their changing location. Parked, looking at them is as mesmerizing as it is painful: very mildly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;1. When a robin doesn't fly away when approached, it's an audacious little bastard. This is thought.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2. The erotics of wildlife are awfully familiar. A shy animal is exciting, a bold one is lewd. Another thought.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3. (1) and (2) don't make much of a story. Not much of a thought.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4. Someone who can narrate their thoughts without being defensive or boring, and without trying too hard to entertain, deserves awe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5. (4) sounds a lot like the ideal animal, doesn't it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;6. (5) is defensive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teeth itch, but can't be scratched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's little difference between staring idly at browser tabs, and staring idly at objects in a room. The latter, however, makes better cinema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not surprising that someone whose job is to plan off-campus activities for students is not at all cognizant of the structural problems in their efforts to create belonging. Nonetheless, when such a person states that their policy is &amp;quot;I just tell 'em to get out there!,&amp;quot; it's depressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who isn't an idiot doesn't think of the historical past as merely that foolish time before we understood what we do now, yet it is an almost universally accepted way of thinking about oneself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charm is impossible to trust, like Deloware, and charm is impossible to ruffle, like Deloware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may not be different kinds of objects. To a young goat, everything is a potential platform, however precarious. To a goat in heat, everything is sex. To the insufferable, everything is encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If everything is insufferable, everything is sufferable, even pleasant.

Yes, there was a bachelor-party spite of the woman who, ironically, pushed her boyfriend unwillingly into the other man's company. Still I almost tweeted &amp;quot;a male vamp on Nashville!&amp;quot; and then &amp;quot;homosocial music-making on Nashville!&amp;quot; I didn't tweet either, though, because the word &amp;quot;homosocial&amp;quot; seems to imply the libidinal world of &lt;em&gt;Nashville&lt;/em&gt;, in which the only energy comes from relationships between a man and a woman. (Even the two men's companionship seemed to eminate from the negative vehemence of Gunnar's attachment to Scarlett, who he vehemently ignores for the evening.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand the purpose of the word, but the discursive need to seperate the sexual from the social mirrors a societal need to do the same. Even subtle shades of sexuality in social relationships tend to be treated as a taint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, it's the subject of a joke. Any hint of eroticism or even romantic attachment between straight men is deemed, with a sneer or a giggle, &amp;quot;bromance,&amp;quot; and between women it's a &amp;quot;girl crush.&amp;quot; These epithets near describing the psychological muddiness of these waters like a yuppie nears a panhandler: with great trepidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not a joke, then with outright paranoia, as in &amp;quot;no homo,&amp;quot; though this, too, tends to be stated &amp;quot;ironically.&amp;quot; The most earnest version of this I've heard is &amp;quot;I'm not gay, but.&amp;quot; Apparently, the nature of acceptable homosocial relationships has been so restricted that it seems necessary to specify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the increasing tolerance of homosexuality seems to come not increasing flexibility of what is normal, but the opposite. Straightness has just further consolidated itself as pure reproductivity, and gay and lesbian also denote rigid sets of behavior. The point of labelling, it seems, is to seperate sexuality from sociality as accurately as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever sexes are involved, gender intervenes to make certain interactions between individuals categorically innocent or categorically sexual. While the actual children part of reproductivity has shifted a bit since the 19th century, its logic is only becoming more extreme. One is presumed to interact with those of one's sexual preference only for sexual purposes, and sex is that thing done with genitals, if not exclusively penetrative. Straight being the category whose anxieties I suspect produce this need to specify, it's no surprise I have yet to hear the word &amp;quot;heterosocial.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in &lt;em&gt;Nashville&lt;/em&gt;, the idea that a man and a woman can interact innocently is as crazy as the idea that two women or two women can write music together. So this new hunk of a character, I find an exciting threat. He seems not to care who he seduces to get what he wants (what everyone wants in &lt;em&gt;Nashville&lt;/em&gt;--a record deal). Those of the literalist school of sexuality would tell me that he doesn't want to fuck Gunnar, and I would agree. But what exactly is he soliciting from Gunnar by being so schmoozey? It seems to me, much the same thing he's soliciting from Scarlett. Maybe lust for money in this economy will temporarily cure us of our preoccupying anxieties about who wants to fuck who.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oddly, while he's motivated by desperation, there seems to be nobody on the show more hopeful. Moving forward, getting what he wants, does not seem to be a process of attrition. Rather, he's cheerfully, selfishly, bringing the warmth back to a toxic heterosexual couple. A threesome seems on the horizon. Perhaps for some, extending the sexual union to three and beyond is the only way for otherwise conventional people to mitigate the feeling that life, and especially partnership, is a series of losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here I must confess the source of all this talk of attrition. I had a bit of a fit, not too long ago. I was complaining--misguidedly, but maybe that's the point--about the coupledness of my friends to someone I don't actually know very well. I thought afterwards, if he wanted to get to know me, well, he is. Moodiness and all. My complaint was that time with these friends has to be fought for, and often they only spent time away from their significant other when the significant other is occupied. I don't think anybody benefits from spending that much time together, from assuming that all of their time will be spent with one person unless otherwise specified. I say this because I have been guilty of the worst kind of this cowardice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This affable man was confused by my frustration. That's just life, he said, you grow up, you &amp;quot;evolve.&amp;quot; That was the word he used. And I suppose evolution, in its scientific sense, is the consolidation of normativity. He thought my melancholic attachment to old friendships was childish. Adults rearrange their entire lives around one romantic attachment. Adult friendships are played out in &amp;quot;guy time,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;girls night out,&amp;quot; and other explicitly sexed, explicitly nonsexual time. I ought to adjust, just as they adjusted to their partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is the case, I've never felt more peter-pan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Months later, I overhear &amp;quot;stay positive and change the topic.&amp;quot; This is how one stays with someone one is made uncomfortable enough by to have to change the topic, and this is perhaps what I should have done, rather than ranted at him. Then again, why?&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/04/homosocial.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4052194874891450208'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4052194874891450208'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4262466906522510456</id><published>2013-04-09T02:16:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2013-04-09T12:28:23.690-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Same Old Story</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Some cultivated accents of varying distance across the Atlantic. I dragged a thermos of tea to every class. I've repeated this several times, so feel free to tune me out. In addition to the tea, I made a point of being very tuned in, even if (or because) certain teachers in elementary school thought that looking out the window meant I wasn't. Drinking tea in class seems like an ostentatious distraction, but it's a beverage of alertness, something imagined to bring about clarity. I did imagine. I was drinking it to bring the world into focus, and with it the teacher's instruction, confirming my general teacher's petness. Conspicuously, I do not recall ever drinking it to wake myself up during Geometry, whose whirring projector, dim lights, and instructor all lulled me just shy enough of sleep not to draw attention to myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tea, though, was of a particular character I was obsessed with then, but today I would call overbrewed. It had no milk, yet often, it was just the sort of tea that cries out for milk, like an infant does, by being unbearable. But unbearable, too, can be bearable. Assam was made to take milk, but that doesn't mean its wanton manipulations stop after it gets it. It wouldn't be so pleasurable to drown its unpleasantness if tannic intimations did not remain underneath all that soothing milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such tea is its own drowning, taken in small sips as if it were something stronger, drying out the mouth, seeming to close off the oriface entirely, even if liquid continues going down it. In any case, while tea flows the rest is slowed. (Which is a funny bit of selective attention, really, because when tea dries you out, it's because you're pissing every five minutes.) Intake slows to a sumptuous constipation (meanwhile, the bowels liquidate). It may still be possible, however, to regurgitate if asked. The flavor does tend to give that sense. However, as I've said far too many times, it gives way to sweetness, what at first tastes like soap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's nothing so posessive as negation, and here I am after all these years, continuing claim this counteringestive gesture. Carrying a bottle of tea around high school was a way of putting a seal (pun intended) on my terror and hatred of the place, but it was also something exuberant, a way of bringing elsewhere with me. Of course, you could argue exuberance has no need for all this holding--neither absence in nor presence away. But never mind that thing that others seem to, for lack of a better word, have. I have tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One could also argue--and some have--that people get repetitive and boring--as I keep accusing myself of--precisely because of this melancholic retentiveness. But what exactly lies beyond attachment but more attachment? That, I suppose, is their point: One ought to forget that one is repeating oneself. Change is less substantive than it is imagined or recounted. But don't think of it that way. The point is to tell an entertaining story. Something fresh, something new. So that those listening feel fresh and new. It's a kind of juice bar, out there. Everyone's dying to see something squeezed that'll get them trimmer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/4262466906522510456/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/04/same-old-story.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4262466906522510456'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4262466906522510456'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/04/same-old-story.html' title='Same Old Story'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4597856141260319352</id><published>2013-04-03T21:20:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2013-05-16T16:21:12.624-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='There Is Only Memoir'/><title type='text'>Seoul Bound for Eternal Damnation?</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I wake up to find that listening to All Things Considered causes nearby people to act as if I just yelled &amp;quot;the end is near!&amp;quot; (They glance over with a frightened expression, cross the street, and grab hold of their wallets.) Generally, I have a hard time paying attention--pleasant ambient noise, reassuring me that things are happening in the world, and that people are talking about them. But not today. Maybe my standards are lower than, for instance, the &amp;quot;rising pressure to increase gas taxes&amp;quot;? The news casters all sounded so deeply bored with the world on which they were reporting that the only communicative act left to them that seemed to broadcast out of their cocoons of despair were puns, and only because puns are the treadmills of locution. I thought I heard Robert Siegel trying to contain his glee at having actually uttered &amp;quot;the hard freeze following the Arab Spring.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have to say, I shared this enthusiasm. The alternative quickly availed itself when someone earnestly observed that the Diaz-Canel government is launching &amp;quot;what appears to be a carefully orchestrated campaign to ready the island for an uncertain post-Castro future.&amp;quot; It's almost as if there are politics that occur outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, if they do, they're threatening and serious, threats taken seriously. They threatened. I'm serious. If you're sick of me repeating myself, I assure you, it's a cycle of transgression. The word &amp;quot;bellicose&amp;quot; was repeated so many times during this hour that I wasn't sure what it meant anymore, if anything. Whatever it was, nobody approved. Others stumbled over words I assume because they too could not get the image of a younger--very serious--Harrison Ford out of there head whenever they started to say &amp;quot;clear,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;present,&amp;quot; and, no, don't say that one, er, &amp;quot;threat,&amp;quot; oh what the hell--&amp;quot;danger.&amp;quot; Truly, language was a prickly morass, so uncertain that some took to stating as unequivocally as possible what they take and continue to take at face value. I was witnessing a kind of cold war escalation of rhetoric. Words were not to be trusted and had to be armored with more words, and those were not enough, and some sort explosion loomed on the horizon, or so they seemed to be saying, possibly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/4597856141260319352/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/04/seoul-bound-for-eternal-damnation.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4597856141260319352'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4597856141260319352'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/04/seoul-bound-for-eternal-damnation.html' title='Seoul Bound for Eternal Damnation?'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4707396427270303455</id><published>2013-04-01T11:35:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2013-04-01T14:53:34.093-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Will Sound Stupid By The End of the Book'/><title type='text'>Hunger</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Usually temperature was a battle,&amp;quot; but every once in a while one gets smug. One finds &amp;quot;the particular ecstacy in greeting&amp;quot; the perfect temperature. Then again, is it the knowledge that one is in perfect temperature--the posession of which is smugness--that gives such ecstacy, or the lost time of not knowing, of not being aware of temperature at all? Irina is witnessing--always, happily, worryingly, a bit too late--the dissolution of both consciousness and control. It's perfect and it's a bit frightening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same could be said of food. I'm constantly wondering if I've eaten enough to stave off hunger hours later, and this worrying feels a great deal like hunger, if it isn't in fact the feeling itself. I say hours, but I think of it as forever. The point of eating becomes to create an infinite duration of not worrying about eating. Perfection is quite a load to burden eating with, making it something to worry about, and such heavy expectations tend to make the act itself awfully light, hardly noticable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in a while, though, I'm overcome (or rather, I just barely perceive that something is barely perceptable) with smugness. Too exhausted to worry about eating, the hours in retrospect seem not to have been counted. I did not interpret the restless gnawing an hour after a large meal as hunger, as I tend to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I have to say that when I was thinking &amp;quot;I'm not hungry&amp;quot; with an air of accomplishment, I was sitting down to a snack. This was not a contradiction, in part because the snack was inedible. Yet I was eating it. Are samosas gross, or were these gross samosas? Old, greasy pastry thick with dry chickpea mash. Their disgustingness was more comforting than off-putting, though. I only felt compelled to eat them out of a pointless, neurotic aversion to waste. But the fact that they were nasty was so--what? Undemanding? Time did not expand or &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot;; it was already more than one could ever need. It was inconceivable that it ever wouldn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is why I missed reading Lionel Shriver, I think. &lt;em&gt;We Need to Talk About Kevin&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Post-Birthday World&lt;/em&gt; are different in form, but they share a pervasive distaste. It's like the astringency of tea at the back of the throat, absolving one's mouth from consuming food. It's not that Shriver's irritable characters don't swallow, so to speak, but things come back up and don't go down easily. The nausea is an oddly permeable prophylactic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irina's discovery of her lack of appetite for a better temperature comes when she's getting what she wants, even if she didn't know she wanted it. My moment of equanimity seems at first not to involve such crisscrossing of appetites, but then, I had given up on the day being useful or productive in any way, and not as a decision. Irina gave up on her non-marriage of nine years, and, indeed, the whole lifestyle that surrounds it, without intending to. Reading her &amp;quot;go wobbly&amp;quot; with slice after slice of chocolate-cappucino cake from Tesco, brandy, &amp;quot;a secret packet of cigarettes&amp;quot; and blasting Tori Amos' &lt;em&gt;Little Earthquakes&lt;/em&gt; is an unattainable wish-fulfillment, not because any of these things sound particularly pleasurable themselves, but because she has so much rigidity--&amp;quot;trout and broccoli&amp;quot;--to make a mess of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My attempts to impose rigidity on my life (no, I'm not saying I'm free; I'm saying I'm lazy) can only be endured with constant snacking, or rather, constant worrying. Otherwise, the thread of the next thing and the next thing is lost, and I suddenly realize how exhausting it all is. The drain seems to have come to the same realization; it has stopped draining. The stagnant water festers. But finally--&lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt;--it has stopped stoppping-draining-stopping-draining. No more gurgling in the middle of the night.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/4707396427270303455/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/04/hunger.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4707396427270303455'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4707396427270303455'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/04/hunger.html' title='Hunger'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-5865521336116798437</id><published>2013-03-24T12:53:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2013-03-24T13:35:01.300-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>Behavior</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vulture.com/2013/03/tv-review-top-of-the-lake.html"&gt;Vulture's review of &lt;em&gt;Top of the Lake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had me at &amp;quot;Jane Tennison&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Elizabeth Moss.&amp;quot; I would never have thought these names--one fictional, one not--would be in the same paragraph, but now that they were, it made sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first the reviewer, Matt Zoller Seitz, sounds like someone &amp;quot;who's watched in dismay over the last 21 years as program after program tried to be the next &lt;em&gt;Prime Suspect&lt;/em&gt; and failed miserably,&amp;quot; and like someone who's watched &lt;em&gt;Top of the Lake&lt;/em&gt;. But maybe he only skimmed it. Why else such confusion about the motives of a character whose frustration we are so often asked to share?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After watching the first two episodes, this sentence borders on unprofessional and nonsensical: &amp;quot;Robin’s behavior at first seems erratic, at times bordering on unprofessional and nonsensical, until you start learning her secrets and studying her interactions with the townspeople and with her mother, who’s suffering from cancer.&amp;quot; Surely I am not so Sarah Lund-addled that her &amp;quot;behavior&amp;quot; (what is she, a case study?) only seems normal to me? Saying that &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; are asked to share Robin's frustration may be premature, of course, but the idea that the show speaks to me alone is absurd narcisism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sort of singling out is the atmosphere that Robin inhabits. The men of the local police force, and almost everyone else, for that matter, consider her a looney eccentric at best, and more often an irrational (tell me, what do &amp;quot;erratic,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;unprofessional,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;nonsensical&amp;quot; add up to?) inconvenience--a pain in the ass. This is for the obvious &amp;quot;reason&amp;quot;; when the police chief hears she's a she, he says &amp;quot;oh, fuck, well, this is going to be a painful.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trajectory of Seitz's view of Robin is exactly the police chief's: he tolerates her and then seems to soften once he finds her reasonable (in Seitz's terms, &amp;quot;learning her secrets&amp;quot;). But the way he communicates his newfound respect, praising the way she &amp;quot;handled that&amp;quot; (a briefing) when they sit down for coffee, makes you wonder. Patronizing sweet nothings come as easily as the sunlight through the windows in a cute coffee shop. You know he wouldn't take any of his boys here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We learn that her mother is ill before we even meet her. Later, Robin asks her &amp;quot;why do I feel manipulated?&amp;quot; but it's clear in the first scene in her mother's house that manipulation is afoot. To someone on the phone (her fiance, I now assume) Robin says &amp;quot;Mum's doing well. She might even be happy finally.&amp;quot; Finally, now that she has a reason to be unhappy, she can be happy. She can summon her daughter to take care of her--&amp;quot;I know, whatever she needs&amp;quot;--because who knows how much more time she has. The pull of love-cum-obligation is so strong that Robin has to ask her &amp;quot;can you spare me for the afternoon?&amp;quot; What exactly she can do for her mother the entire day, I couldn't say. The irony is, the reason Robin ends up brandishing as trump is &amp;quot;it's a child.&amp;quot; She escapes the need of her mother--who, no longer needed by her daughter, has to settle for being needy--to be needed by a child. If doing so is Robin's &amp;quot;behavior,&amp;quot; it's anything but &amp;quot;nonsensical.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If on the other hand the behavior in question is her restless investigatory tendencies, then it's less erratic than impulsive, in a genre way. That's what hard-boiled detectives do. Besides, down that road, along which characters are just collections of predictably crazy impulses, is &amp;quot;David Lynch-style characters,&amp;quot; which the Sundance Channel bafflingly proclaims its own show has. What comes to mind of course is &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt;, whose characters mindlessly repeat their particular compulsions. They're all &amp;quot;characters&amp;quot; in that sense of being both eccentric and utterly stuck in their eccentricity. Top of the Lake may operate in a psychosexually charged register, but the characters are not like Lynch's--they're more rational, they retain the capacity to surprise, and they're less cariacatured. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this principle-of-chaos difference feminism doesn't stop with Robin. Seitz describes the landscape as &amp;quot;pregnant with narrative potential and buried secrets,&amp;quot; and goes on to say that &amp;quot;Campion's narrative landscapes are as female in their imagery and concerns as Martin Scorsese's are male, utterly and unapologetically so.&amp;quot; I do think that any account of the landscape's role in this show is bound to be clumsy (for instance, I felt like saying &amp;quot;mesmerizing&amp;quot;), but this sounds as lazy as "water = semiotic chora." I get the feminism he's going for, Campion being unapologetic about the femaleness her show, but I find the idea that there are female and male concerns a bit risable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm reminded of Robin playing darts in the bar.

I have had a cold for the past two weeks, and I disingenuously tell myself that hot hot chicken soup with fresh lime juice (for the vitamin C of course--certainly not a dubious &amp;quot;fusion&amp;quot; impulse!) would help. It does have a medicinal quality. I can't decide if drinking it is tasty or a chore. In lieu the symptom, the broth makes me cough, which is cathartic in its way, like crying while chopping onions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gas range in my apartment has the opposite problem that an electric has. &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; is enough to caramelize onions, and the only possible utility of &amp;quot;Max&amp;quot; (right above &amp;quot;8&amp;quot;) is boiling water. A month and I still misgauge just how hot it is, always worrying that &amp;quot;Min&amp;quot; cannot possibly be hot enough, bumping the dial up a bit and then back down and back up again, and rationalizing that it's at &amp;quot;Min&amp;quot; if I look at it without bending down to see exactly where the mark lines up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cast-iron pan I have has a concavity in the middle--what might be called a &amp;quot;dip&amp;quot; on a road sign. The lower the heat, the more the flame heats the middle, which is exactly where the pan is lowest and thinnest. Turning it down sometimes does exactly what I mean to avoid, yet at the same time heats everything less. So a low flame sometimes both burns and fails to heat. This leads to for example burnt grilled cheese with not-quite melted cheese, or still-gooey pancakes with a burnt spot. I exaggerate, but if I didn't there wouldn't be much to say about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grilled cheese and pancakes are of course not foods that should be made, and the grease that flies off them accumulates on the stove, the fridge, the walls, the fan and the air. The windows may be opened, the fan may be turned on, but a certain not entirely unpleasant smell persists. The smell of the oven when it's on is far more intense and acrid, yet it can be evacuated out the window within an hour, and does not affect what's baked inside.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/3973134906340402432/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/03/fire.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3973134906340402432'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3973134906340402432'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/03/fire.html' title='Fire'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-5599858734717693370</id><published>2013-03-12T13:36:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2013-05-16T16:21:12.628-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='There Is Only Memoir'/><title type='text'>Comfortably Rusty</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;In my room, the sun primarily does two things. It overheats the room, and it blinds me. Yet I am careful to avoid covering my two windows. I think of the light that comes through them as preicous. My desk is placed right below the windows, so that it is a kind of shrine to the light. My computer screen is in front of the bit of wall between the two windows, so that it does not block the windows, and so that the bright windows do not glare behind the screen. Yet when the sun does come out--the moment for which all of this is in preparation--I squint. Inside, the sunlight is a nuissance, but it seems worse to close the blinds. I feel compelled especially in this city to enjoy the sun. It's so rare. Spending time inside sheltered from the sun comes with a niggling sense of waste. Even reclining in a sunbeam on my bed feels like some kind of rebellion against the compulsion to go outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent most of the other day outside, in the most beautiful weather since I've moved here. Though, beautiful is not really the word for sunshine in this climate. Illicit, perhaps--the clear sky is so unfathomably blue that I feel that I both really should and really shouldn't be looking at it. It's as if the world's clothes have flown off, which is to say that aside from these conflicting pressures, a clear day is not much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of that day I found a west-facing porch where food and coffee were served. In a rocking chair I sat engrossed in a book. To be engrossed is as rare as the sun here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking home, I attributed the relaxed state to having worked that day. Work tends to relieve anxiety, turning expansive, anxious free time into constrained, relaxed free time. Thinking this, I noticed that the sun had gone down, and that I was congratulating myself for the remission of anxiety--something I hadn't noticed was there until it wasn't. My thoughts soon began defensively claiming that they were not being defensive. I didn't want to admit that their jumbled, nervous character had returned. My pace hurried. My eyes darted. Surely, I thought, I couldn't blame my mood on the lack of sun?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portland had returned to its presumed state of diffuse light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the next day--another sunny day, which as someone living in Portland I can only hyperbolically call miraculous--I found myself willing the sun down. It's such a pain, enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a comic, &amp;quot;Orygun,&amp;quot; that is almost nothing but jokes about the rain. Its profusion of tired jokes about how much it rains here make a joke about how many tired jokes about how much it rains here can be made. It's attempting--exhaustively and exhaustingly--to make light of living under the dark clouds of a stereotype of dark clouds. Of course, those same clouds are a blanket to hide under.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're the kind of jokes that you groan and roll your eyes at, but they can be oddly illuminating. Not because they're true, exactly, but because they extremely state things that are already thought to be true. I'm really just thinking of one joke: &amp;quot;People in Oregon don't sunburn. They rust.&amp;quot; This malady of being drenched rather than overexposed sounds like a more recent commentary on Portland's relationship to ambition: &lt;em&gt;Portlandia&lt;/em&gt;'s &amp;quot;where young people go to retire.&amp;quot; These quips ring awfully true, and, combined with the fact of the grey weather, a colorless puddle of truth congeals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an autobiographical story published in an old issue of &lt;em&gt;Tin House&lt;/em&gt;, Katie Crouch tells her ex in New York--who is there because he's enlived by New York--that he &amp;quot;wouldn't like it here. You wouldn't like the sleepy way people drive.&amp;quot; Another membrane that once read cannot be peeled off. The cars &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; proceed lacksadaisically, politely, as if their drivers are encased in another skin, and driving through a thick liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Crouch pitting the two places against each other speaks to, New York is perceived as having the opposite relationship to ambition. It's a city whose drives seem right up against the skin, whose drivers drive restlessly. They find Portlanders &amp;quot;so nice.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's true, benignness is everywhere. People say hello passing on the street, they mythologize breakfast, and half of the pages of both of their popular weekly publications are filled with pot culture. Portland's persona is so laid back, it can't be. What's all that pot meant to counteract, anyway? Have you ever heard such discontented snark than from the retired?&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/5599858734717693370/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/03/comfortably-rusty.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/5599858734717693370'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/5599858734717693370'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/03/comfortably-rusty.html' title='Comfortably Rusty'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-2000495001118648320</id><published>2013-02-25T12:48:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2013-04-01T14:53:57.647-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Will Sound Stupid By The End of the Book'/><title type='text'>Everything in One Room</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3Q9n7FRCDrM/USvNrkW8_yI/AAAAAAAAEx0/L_cJVTM5P7Y/s1600/0224131549.jpg" imageanchor="1" &gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3Q9n7FRCDrM/USvNrkW8_yI/AAAAAAAAEx0/L_cJVTM5P7Y/s320/0224131549.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature is said to abhor a vacuum, and Harald in &lt;em&gt;The Group&lt;/em&gt; is &amp;quot;a perfect fanatic about waste space.&amp;quot; For someone whose ideal apartment is &amp;quot;a machine for living,&amp;quot; his speech, though mechanical, lacks economy. He's so verbosely inexpressive--of which lifting Le Courbusier's famous phrase is an example--he has class stupidity. He is, despite his fanaticism, a fan of lofty form evacuated of content: He reads the Old Testament and Marx &amp;quot;for the style.&amp;quot; His vision of the perfect household might use space efficiently, but perhaps it can be more clearly regarded as empty forms: &amp;quot;everything built in: bookcases, beauros, chests. The beds were going to be mattresses and springs, supported by four low pegs, and they were thinking about having a table to eat on that would fold up into the wall like a Murphy bed--a single leaf of wood shaped like an ironing board but broader.&amp;quot; Having just moved into an apartment consisting of two rooms and less than 200 square feet, this domestic vision filled me not only with dread, but with a kind of cross-eyed, doubled sense of too-closeness. Not only did it describe the very conceits that would in theory liberate a tiny space like my own (and therefore underline the tinyness of that space) but there is a peculiar cramped sensation that accompanies reading about an aspect of your life that you try to ignore. Like watching &lt;em&gt;Portlandia&lt;/em&gt; in Portland, or watching a television show about someone with a stressful occupation having just come from a stressful occupation earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is almost nothing in &lt;em&gt;The Group&lt;/em&gt; that isn't a little funny. The narration is uniformly amused and cruel. One might characterize this disposition as &amp;quot;detached,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;distant,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;cold,&amp;quot; like Lakey is said to be. But while not warm, the narration has friction with its many subjects. That is, this kind of mercilessness seems to come not of distance but intimacy. If it were cinema, we might be close enough to see the pores of the group's skin--almost dehumanizingly close, and not nearly distant enough to be sexy. This is not a narrator who runs on desire, projecting into other minds, but rather seems to be laboring to survive among overabundant overcloseness--the group. The strategy is to put all those impinging in their places, to use intimate knowledge to characterize them so accurately that they're kept temporarily at bay. Rather than narrating from a position of presumed subjectivity, the narration is in the process of becoming a subject, eking out a tiny space. Not a room of one's own; not a space from which to speak. If the space were secure, there would be no reason to speak. There would be wonderful silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing that's not a little funny, but some are funnier than others, like a fold-out table that's shaped like an ironing board. &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/12/this-is-not-forty.html"&gt;&amp;quot;Using ironing boards as dining tables&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; can be a handy metonym for poor, aspiring professionals. Because of course separation of functions is just what they're hoping their future career's monetary gains will enable their living space to have. Space is, indeed, something money buys and tends to mark class. The vast, alienating interiors of the rich have been a cinematic cliché at least since &lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt;. The classic image is of the married couple sitting at opposite ends of a table so long they can't hear what the other is saying. It's distance that attenuates relationality, that brings occupants all too close to themselves. But these same estates can be romanticized, not so much for their height and breadth, but for their labyrinthine profusion of rooms, the seclusion of which enables a romantic intimacy. &lt;em&gt;Brideshead Revisisted&lt;/em&gt;, for example, is nostalgic for the getting-lost-in-rooms-ness of the English country estate. There's always a room to escape to. There are so many walls that both individuation and eros are possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lh7IdsJ_TxY/USvNxZG-RTI/AAAAAAAAEx8/yP6l7PguPBs/s1600/0224131556.jpg" imageanchor="1" &gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lh7IdsJ_TxY/USvNxZG-RTI/AAAAAAAAEx8/yP6l7PguPBs/s320/0224131556.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmentalism, like the technocracy Harald is so enamored with, views waste with a moral intensity. Interior space must be conserved not because the world must fit neatly together, but because space takes materials to build, and takes energy to heat. Smaller is better, and after all it's cozier, too. This idea has become a movement of sorts, of building and living in very small houses. It comes, of course, with a prescription that one ought to spend more time outdoors anyway. One will want to go outside, if one lives in constant indoor proximity with another. As delightful as &lt;em&gt;The Group&lt;/em&gt; is, not everyone can channel their frictional mood into a novel. Moreover, &lt;em&gt;The Group&lt;/em&gt;, as you've already surmised from its title even if you haven't read it, does not spring from the friction between romantic partners. The goal is space among others, not space enough to romanticize an other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other night I was walking behind a man and a woman, who I assumed from the enthusiasm of their speech were both drunk and on a date. They were arguing, but their tones were not serious. That's different from mock-arguing. The woman, who had moved here six months ago from a city I didn't catch, was defending Portland against the man, who was from Tulsa. &amp;quot;But Tulsa is so clean and lifeless! You don't understand! The people here are so nice!&amp;quot; (I assume nice meant quaint.) The two just went on like this, completely but cheerfully disagreeing about not especially fundamental issues. They were loud, and listening to them was fatiguing. It felt like we were all being rubbed with sandpaper, but they didn't seem to mind. These were two people who may as well have been yelling from separate rooms; their only conceivable connection was sexual. In the same room together they could not have kept it up; that that their words were not hitting home would hit home. Walking down the street, though, allowed them not to care. In an expansive public space their nonconversation could be euphoric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's bad enough being in constant indoor proximity with oneself. Having everything condensed into one or two rooms means there can be almost no spatial metaphors to rely on to separate aspects of life at home. The only possible changes of scene become shifts in perspective, rather than different rooms. It could be argued, of course, that the difference between sitting in the chair by the window to laying in bed means just as little as the difference between the living room and the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary McCarthy has, nonetheless, managed to make the difference between the time &lt;em&gt;The Group&lt;/em&gt; is about and the time she wrote it matter. From this era of hyperbolic disgust towards foods fashionable in the midcentury (all things gelatinned, canned, full of preservatives), the novel sounds equally disgusted with the food fashionable in the 30s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know, I always have to drag my writing woes into it. I never know how to end anything. Pieces of writing that I don't finish are like a sticky gelatin. They break into tiny chunks that I can't get off. I keep making infinitesimal edits to sentences that even though nobody else has read them are shameful, and uncomfortably close. They populate whatever room I'm in, crop up on the sides of buildings and the trunks of trees. McCarthy has figured it out: the only distance is time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/2000495001118648320/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/02/everything-in-one-room.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2000495001118648320'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2000495001118648320'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/02/everything-in-one-room.html' title='Everything in One Room'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3Q9n7FRCDrM/USvNrkW8_yI/AAAAAAAAEx0/L_cJVTM5P7Y/s72-c/0224131549.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-7676904532171868274</id><published>2013-02-09T16:01:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2013-02-09T16:03:29.318-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Robo Taco</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://streetmeatnation.blogspot.com/2013/02/robo-taco-portland-oregon.html"&gt;I refuse to photograph these tacos.

Sometimes it seems to me it's only the music that mesmerizes. In Star Control II--nostalgia for which I designed a website around--there are long stretches of time traveling between star systems across monotonous expanses of deep red or blinding green, and, of course, repeating music. There's no part of the game that isn't scored, and the sounds of "hyperspace" and "quasispace" are the most mesmeric, and have the least movement. The monotony makes these songs &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; repeatable. Like a tiling background image, micro-patterns within each tile make the tiles less discernible than macro-patterns. Tiny movements make both the tiling images and the repeating music seem oddly wasteful, as the repeated tiles consist of many almost identical repeating sub-tiles. The perception that the tiles make up something larger than themselves than they are lies in the "almost"--the subtle variations that are not meant to create catharsis so much as enable getting lost in. The lengthy journeys between stars not only confer a sense of the game world's immensity, but put me in a trance. Of course, I took any excuse to space out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Star Control II's interludes were basically very monotonous music videos--there was no need for interaction except to avoid an occasional pursuing ship--Tyrian's trances &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; its gameplay. Does this mean playing it is incredibly dull, or endlessly fascinating? Again, its capacity to mesmerize seems largely due to its music, which is particularly compelling, for computer game music. It even has a separate jukebox program, which plays all of the game's songs in random order. But when I have tried to run this jukebox in the background while occupied with something other than Tyrian, the music gets old very quickly, and I skip half the songs. In the game, a song repeats until the level is completed, and rarely tires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is something mesmerizing yet oddly disengaging about playing Tyrian. I wouldn't say there's no tension, but the tension is subsumed into the game's aesthetic principle. Enemies do not come into play wily-nilly or out of view, as they do in first-person shooters, but swoop onto the screen in orderly processions. Rather than the twitchyness required of first-person shooters, your survival here often depends upon your gracefulness. The level I remember best is full of swinging chains (deadly, of course), undulating spikes, and narrow, zigzagging corridors. A successful run scribes a kind of calligraphy. Though perhaps ballet is a better metaphor, as success depends upon synchronicity with all of the other moving bodies on screen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caught up--abstracted--in the choreography and visual spectacle, it is easy to let my thoughts wander. It might even be easi&lt;i&gt;er&lt;/i&gt;. Playing the game becomes a barely cognitive impulse, like driving a car, and the constraint of limited engagement frees up thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is only half true; the other half is a wish. I tell myself that I'm thinking when I play Tyrian, because I become so addicted. It is at least a mercifully short game. I've played it through three times, the first more than a decade ago because a friend had it on his computer, and the second two at the bottom of a depression. The game provides the relief of giving up. It's ability to entrance is precious to a restless mind. I stay up late playing it all the way through, letting it suspend me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it seems to require a willingness or need to be subjected to its constraints. I have tried to play it more recently, and it's too pneumatic, too disinterested in the future. Rather than a vastness, it is a surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To characterize the game as disinterested in the future is not quite fair. There is an upgrade system. After every level there's a store, with slightly different items to make your ship faster, tougher, or more lethal. But playing the levels is not, as in games like Diablo, drowned in the desire for better stuff. Playing is pleasurable for reasons other than seeing spectacular evidence of your latest upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XD_99Y8dJsw/UQsa2eYT_xI/AAAAAAAAEwk/sGaUZUHhLhQ/s1600/tyrian-firepower.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XD_99Y8dJsw/UQsa2eYT_xI/AAAAAAAAEwk/sGaUZUHhLhQ/s400/tyrian-firepower.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trouble is that having a better ship eventually lessens the need to be acrobatic. If you are capable of destroying almost everything in your path, playing becomes reduced to evading those few indestructible obstacles. As my involvement attenuates, the game stops mesmerizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore it's toward the end of the game, when upgrades have been exhausted, that the present gets hollowed out by the future: I play merely to finish the game. And so I always end with the sense that the game is dull.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/1708018112675265610/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/02/remembered-games-tyrian.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1708018112675265610'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1708018112675265610'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/02/remembered-games-tyrian.html' title='Remembered Games: Tyrian'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YGJPnIMMl34/UQsatZRdQXI/AAAAAAAAEwY/Kd2CTqoq3Hk/s72-c/sc2-hyperspace.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-6475379379828021305</id><published>2013-01-30T16:20:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2013-02-09T16:02:11.898-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>White Noise in Nashville</title><content type='html'>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just noise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.popjustice.com/songs/disclosure-feat-alunageorge-white-noise/"&gt;White noise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;principled&amp;quot; guitarist plays a concert at the country club for the white mayoral candidate, even though he supports the black mayor, who is his sponsor. This makes &amp;quot;support&amp;quot; a funny word for him to use. He's &amp;quot;only doing it,&amp;quot; he irritably stipulates, as a &amp;quot;favor&amp;quot; for star of the show and of the concert, who is also the candidate's wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trouble was on my tail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He followed me like a hound&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Til I moved that one step on to glory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And off of that changing ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You pull my strings one by one&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Until you get me onto one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulling someone's strings until they get onto one is not a bad metaphor for the show. It's not a musical, and characters don't spill their guts in song, exactly. They do, but there is a tantalizing uncertainty in the relation between plot and song, character and performance. An uncertainty that is sometimes invoked by the performers themselves. (&amp;quot;It's acting, you idiot!&amp;quot;) The drama is about whom is singing, writing, or touring with whom, all of which are heavily libidinal with varying levels of explicitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although, while the equation is clearly chemistry = creativity, &amp;quot;libidinal&amp;quot; isn't specific enough. The basic musical element is the duet and songs come almost exclusively out of the sexual charge between a woman and a man. Which of course is why the two female stars (Rayna and Juliette, who are locked in a generational conflict) getting on stage together is &amp;quot;a big event,&amp;quot; as the the head of their label puts it with exploitative relish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To write is to sit together with a guitar between you, which is the man's. When the youngest musical couple first write, it is at his encouraging insistence. Encouragement requires a certain benevolent dementia. Of the poems she wrote he declares &amp;quot;these are songs!&amp;quot; Her book in his hand, he begins strumming chords--&amp;quot;tell me when it sounds like what you heard when you wrote it.&amp;quot; Words between a woman with &amp;quot;heartache&amp;quot; and a man who wears snappy shirts are never just lyrical; they are always lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m hearing static&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’re like an automatic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This genre origin story has an automation both productive and seductive, the two feeding each other, until they don't. It's not sex that &amp;quot;just happens&amp;quot;--it's music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when Rayna and Juliette write together, it's work. &amp;quot;Let's just be professional and get this done,&amp;quot; says Rayna. Work in the sense that their writing is not leavened by heterosexual tension, and in the sense that this scene works on the gendered logic of the show's scenes of writing--scenes that have not had to do much work, like the characters who breeze along on waves of seduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However dramatic the relationship between a picking man and a singing woman can get, it's along romantic lines. When they don't get along, they don't write. Unlike Rayna and Juliette, who write &amp;quot;The Wrong Song&amp;quot; through what sounds like nothing but abrasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a long, long road to independence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I'm leaving you for Tennessee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got demons riding shotgun&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telling me not to go&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what they don't know&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is I'm already gone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the very first lyrics of the show, sung by a woman (Rayna) whose daughter just asked her dad &amp;quot;why does she have to go to work?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6475379379828021305/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/01/white-noise-in-nashville_30.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6475379379828021305'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6475379379828021305'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/01/white-noise-in-nashville_30.html' title='White Noise in Nashville'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-3031502962837410221</id><published>2013-01-17T22:46:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2013-01-17T22:53:43.478-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>Focus</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Sarah Lund's new partner, Borch, is always telling her to focus, and, jarringly, he calls her Sarah. There was, if not onomatopoeia, a consonance of sound and emotion in the exasperated exclamation &amp;quot;Lund!&amp;quot; Her boss, Brix (a patronym that seems to encompass his whole character), still says &amp;quot;Lund.&amp;quot; The trainee investigator has taken after Borch, as if he's he and Lund's child. This appears to be a role he enjoys, sitting in the back seat as the three of them drive off to The End of Civilization, aka Jutland. It must be because of this infectiousness of names that in some nuclear families the mother and father actually call &lt;em&gt;each other&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;mom&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;dad.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danish is full of what to an American ear are wonderfully curt expressions. Even &amp;quot;thanks,&amp;quot; despite having only one syllable, is padded forgivingly with sound in comparison to &amp;quot;tak,&amp;quot; and next to &amp;quot;tak for kaffe&amp;quot; (silent e), &amp;quot;thanks for the coffee&amp;quot; is a windy drawl fit only for a Western. However, &amp;quot;Sarah&amp;quot; uttered by a Dane is even windier than by an American--that short A is long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you're probably wanting to tell me by now, breathy sibilance is hardly the point. That Borch uses her first name shows his familiarity, or his presumption of familiarity, because they once knew each other. &amp;quot;In the academy. We were in the same year,&amp;quot; Lund explains to the kid in the back seat, and happily does not get a chance to answer his next question: &amp;quot;was he your boyfriend?&amp;quot; They're interrupted by the &amp;quot;mand&amp;quot; in question waking up in the passenger seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distracted focus has always been a theme of the show--it is about an obsessive detective, after all--but none of her previous male partners have been as explicit or taken her obsessiveness so personally. She has always run off and disobeyed orders to pursue the investigation (or as her frustrated boss and partner might call it, &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; investigation), but here it has become a problem of fate. The kidnapper keeps setting up payoffs, asking specifically for Lund to make the exchange, and she keeps disobeying what the kidnapper and the police department tell her to do, which are almost the same at this point. When the exchange fails, it appears that the kidnapper may not have intended it to succeed. Brix always insists, because he is beholden to higher offices and regulations, that if Lund hadn't interfered, everything would have gone as planned. Lund insists that her derailing of the exchange was the best hope of being a step ahead of the kidnapper. The second time this happens, she rushes off to get a woman's testimony before it's too late, which it is, because the kidnapper kills her before Lund gets there. If he was trying to distract her by scheduling the exchange, he must not know her very well. On the other hand, it worked because she went along with it up until the last minute. It worked because she is part of the department, not a free agent. She gets briefly distracted by what to the department is the focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borch accuses her of pulling the same last-minute stunts emotionally. &amp;quot;When it comes to emotions, you tend to run away.&amp;quot; His comment alludes to the end of their previous relationship, but he's also trying to provide the emotional intelligence (like a gross Mulder, as we always knew he was) to her relationship with her son, Mark (who may also, unbeknownst to him, be genetically his son). It's hard not to notice the conflation of &amp;quot;your emotions&amp;quot; with him, Borch. More generally, her emotions are conflated with prescriptions. It's unfortunate that she and her son are not full of loving kindness for each other, I guess, but Borch has a (common) notion that because she &lt;em&gt;ought to demonstrate&lt;/em&gt; more love, she therefore &lt;em&gt;has it inside&lt;/em&gt; of her, she just needs to find it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This notion is confronted again and again in her interactions with others, most awkwardly in speaking with Mark's girlfriend, Eva, who might be said to be &amp;quot;full&amp;quot; of sociable talk in the same way Sarah is &amp;quot;full&amp;quot; of feeling for her son. Eva is in fact pregnant, which is what distracts Lund from making the first exchange with the kidnapper (she glimpses Eva and Mark in the subway station). When Eva meets her, Eva tries to include her in enthusiastic talk about how the baby (her grandchild) kicks. She doesn't respond to this, though it instills a nervousness that plays out on her face throughout the conversation. They're mutually bewildered. Eva doesn't know how to be sociable with a woman who can't say the things one says, and Sarah doesn't know how to convincingly simulate the expected response, or, indeed how to be &amp;quot;Sarah.&amp;quot; Both are responding to an anxiety of responsiveness. One lets loose a stream of verbiage; the other says almost nothing. The former not only provides all the material, but sets up a solipsistically hopeful world in which the other's lack of response means only that the shape demanded by her conversational material is present in the other but unexpressed. While this is very much what Borch is doing, too, he angers when Lund does not conform to his imagination, whereas Eva never outwardly acknowledges it. Her difficulty in staying within either of these two frames is one explanation of the antisocial behavior of which her difficulty is supposedly a symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She comes to the hospital with Eva for an ultrasound, and Eva turns to her and says &amp;quot;I'm really glad you're here with me. You might just be doing it for Mark, but I'm really glad you're here.&amp;quot; This may be the nicest thing anyone has ever said to her, while at the same time it expects her to be the person Eva is glad to have there. She smiles, weakly. Then, seeing the fetus on the ultrasound, goes out into the hall to cry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borch repeatedly chides her to focus, and ever since they slept together, he repeatedly tells her that &amp;quot;it meant something to me.&amp;quot; This is an obvious vie for mirrored response (&amp;quot;oh yes, it meant something to me, too!&amp;quot;), but because it's a show of vulnerability, he thinks she's evading &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; emotions. His pushes for reciprocation eventually intensify to the point that he says &amp;quot;no, Sarah, I won't let you just run away again!&amp;quot; Which she responds to, or doesn't, by finding and going down the stairs into the basement of the warehouse they're checking out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She goes down, and the girl they're searching for, Emilie, once had a habit of going up. Amid the show's process of dispersing evidence among its three dramatic arenas (the police, the politicians, and the family), Emilie's brother reveals to his mother that &amp;quot;when she got sick of hearing you and dad fighting, she went to the in-between room,&amp;quot; which turns out to be the attic of her dad's mansion. An attic is less a room than an inevitable effect of a structure's roof and ceiling. Not to be inhabited, it is a necessary space mostly ignored by a house's inhabitants, designed to be outside the life layed out by the house's interior. In this context of a child escaping her parent's fights, &amp;quot;running away&amp;quot; takes on a valence of victimhood rather than frgidity. But what troubles Lund's talk and makes it impossible to respond to Borch seems in part to be the inevitability and limitedness of valences. Borch's wife comes to the police station to drop off her husband's stuff--&amp;quot;which I assume is your fault,&amp;quot; she tells Lund. As the wife's fit of angry speech towards Lund builds, she stands there agitatedly not speaking. &amp;quot;What do you want from him?!&amp;quot; She has become a home wrecker. Frustrated, she says &amp;quot;I don't want any part of this,&amp;quot; and walks off. Admittedly, it's even more troubling to be a something for a detective, for whom the world is ideally more detectable than the self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the eyes of everyone else, her investigation becomes distracted by an interest in what the kidnapper thinks he's avenging. Geographically, it takes the investigators all the way to what is apparently referred to as &amp;quot;peripheral Denmark&amp;quot; by Copenhagen politicians. The show itself forks into several distracting obsessions. The Prime Minister becomes distracted from his reelection campaign by an obsession with his dead son (for him Emilie is a proxy for this loss). Emilie's parents are obsessed with finding her, distracting the father from running the Zeeland corporation, and distracting the mother from her relationship with her boyfriend. Sarah Lund becomes obsessed with solving the murder of the kidnapper's daughter years ago. Which case is the distraction from the other is a matter of ideology. The police are predictably interested only in finding the kidnap victim and punishing the kidnapper. Lund's interest is, at least symbolically, in the cause of which the kidnapping is an effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emilie's life is a token traded among politicians and their constituents. As well as the parallel to losing his son, the PM is interested in her fate because if she's not found alive before the election, people will blame him for it, lose faith in the government, and he'll lose. The country's feeling toward their government is invested in her: The police's competence in finding her reveals the government's decency, not its self-interest. What manifests as a sentimental issue is a political one. The PM finds himself on the negative side of this logic in the death of his son. When Lund and Borch question him about his son, they try to draw connections between his son's suicide and his trip to Jutland, where they suspect him of murdering the kidnapper's daughter. &amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; he says, &amp;quot;they're not connected. He was depressed.&amp;quot; His acceptance of his son's apparent feeling as the ultimate explanation ends up concealing the politics of his son's death, which was not suicide, but occurred because of a concealed effort to conceal the indicting evidence he saw while in Jutland. He is initially furious when he finds this out, but in the end, the PM accepts the lame explanation that his son died because of an accident--an explanation more meaningless than deceitful--and goes on politicking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With similarly glazed eyes, the police has no interest in investigating the death of the kidnapper's daughter beyond appeasing him enough to lead them to Emilie. It would destroy, rather than bolster confidence. Because the murderer is the assistant of the CEO of a corporation that the the Danish economy is said to depend upon, uncovering him would be counterproductive in more than one sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spectacular rescue of a female victim restores the government, the nation, the family, and the economy. The PM is no longer distracted from victory by his dead son, the nation is no longer distracted by the thought of sexual violence, Emilie's mother is no longer distracted by her problems with Emilie's father, and nobody is distracted anymore by the economically disastrous possibility of the Zeeland corporation leaving Denmark, nor by the coercion that such a union is bound by. In short, Emilie may now return to the attic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the kidnapper once did, the man who raped and murdered the kidnapper's daughter confidently dictates fate to Lund: he will never be held responsible. Lund kills him, gets on a plane, and leaves Denmark. Which is more than but also exactly what she has ever done--the most &amp;quot;distracted,&amp;quot; the most &amp;quot;obsessive,&amp;quot; the most &amp;quot;unfeeling&amp;quot; she has been, and the farthest she has &amp;quot;run.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/3031502962837410221/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/01/focus.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3031502962837410221'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3031502962837410221'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/01/focus.html' title='Focus'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-1732961094743581039</id><published>2013-01-11T23:58:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2013-01-12T02:51:10.207-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>Across the Living Room and Other Distances</title><content type='html'>Why does anyone watch anything? Sometimes I really don't know why I do. I watched this youtube video demonstrating a program that creates moveable, resizeable previews of windows. He was watching "Family Guy," which is unerringly awful, but the way he put a preview of it in the corner of his screen while doing other things was like leaving the TV on in the room, which was appealing, somehow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes don't watch what I'm watching. If I say that I don't remember what I watch, it doesn't mean that I wasn't watching. It might point to a particular kind of watching, which is lost to the memory. It could also mean that the kinds of things that count as "memory of" do not include the things I do remember. For example, I might not remember what I watched, but it might still have had an effect on me, which may or may not be a kind of memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The obscurity of what I remember watching is related to the obscurity of why I watch something. Off-hand I remember very little of &lt;i&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt;, and I remembered even less--plot, images, characters--when I wanted to rewatch those movies a year ago. I didn't care much about the lore, the languages, or the CGI battles. In fact, I had amnesia about all of that. I remembered the feeling--the sense of doom. True, this memory had images associated with it--driving to the movie theater in a winter rainstorm, and driving back in the fog, or the other way around, or neither. There was a lot of moonlight, I think. The remembered feeling also had something to do with the introduction. Maybe just Cate Blanchett's voice, or the tone of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CxopdrH5MD8/UPEWDc218zI/AAAAAAAAEvU/GutJwH8zyvQ/s1600/Screenshot+%2528520%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="112" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CxopdrH5MD8/UPEWDc218zI/AAAAAAAAEvU/GutJwH8zyvQ/s200/Screenshot+%2528520%2529.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Peter Jackson at his most memorable&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Maybe I just wanted the movie to give me foreboding strings to make the dark still rather than its usual restlessness. I couldn't say, exactly, but the movie didn't have whatever I wanted. That was apparent early on, but I kept watching. The movie &lt;i&gt;neared&lt;/i&gt; what I had imagined, and I waited for it to near it again, which it did. I was in a kind of orbit. I was disappointed, but sometimes very close to not disappointed. Which might be close to the feeling the movie approached--of things falling away, of a destination infinitely far away. But then, unfortunately, things would come into grasp, and that heroism of having acheived things would return. Comic relief would butt in. Swinging swords would connect. Things not already dead would get in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if "excitement" did not interdict?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/1732961094743581039/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/01/across-living-room-and-other-distances.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1732961094743581039'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1732961094743581039'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/01/across-living-room-and-other-distances.html' title='Across the Living Room and Other Distances'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CxopdrH5MD8/UPEWDc218zI/AAAAAAAAEvU/GutJwH8zyvQ/s72-c/Screenshot+%2528520%2529.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-1136213364022136479</id><published>2013-01-06T13:11:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2013-01-06T17:35:24.875-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>Reading(,) Faces</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of &lt;em&gt;Temple Grandin&lt;/em&gt;, the eponymous addresses us to say that she isn't like other people--she thinks &amp;quot;in pictures.&amp;quot; If thinking in pictures does not seem especially peculiar, the movie does not hold back in demonstrating. It does so with a kind of HUD of sketched diagrams animating over real objects, and by cutting to extradiegetic images--especially photographs and television and movie clips. One point of these brash cinematic maneuvers, I suppose, is that these are diegetic for her. Maybe I should be thankful that it did not treat her mind as a transcendental that may only be hinted at. It's also not strange that a filmmaker would display such gushing admiration for someone who thinks in pictures. It's not strange, though some would eroticize the strange rather than the familiar mind--a poet, a musician, a scientist, an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While pointing toward something grander than can be represented has been avoided, nonetheless, a kind of apotheosis occurs when montage tries to show all the images that run through her consciousness. There is a horse. It turns out she identifies with and loves large hoofed animals more than any human, projecting onto them all of her troubles and comforts. When this horse dies, she asks her closest friend (who happens to be her teacher) &amp;quot;where did it go?&amp;quot; He tells her that the dead live on in our memories. She proceeds to list all of her memories of the horse, which are pictures, which flash on the screen as rapidly as she speaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movie seems to regard this as a supernatural ability. A french teacher asks her testily if she understood what she claims to have read by glancing down at the textbook page for a second. Grandin Glass brings up the image of the textbook page, and she reads aloud from it. There is one of those moments when the people in the movie see what the viewer has seen this whole time. The teacher and the rest of the class are agape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For someone with such a capacious photographic memory, however, she reports difficulty interpreting images. For such a crassly representative film, its inadvertant representation of the filmic principle is exactly the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her upbringing is a struggle between two mothers--­her mother who wants her to be normal, and her aunt who wants her to be happy. In frustration, she reports to her aunt that girls at school &amp;quot;say things like 'why are you so grumpy when I'm happy?' and I say 'but I'm happy!' and they say 'well you don't look happy' and they say 'can't you see I'm faking it? can't you see I'm sad?' I don't know what they're talkin about.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you look like when you're happy?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Like this.&amp;quot; She shows a blank face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to this crisis of face-reading, her aunt gives her a pile of photographs of her face, which they use as flash cards. Her aunt tells her what emotion is on her face in each photo, and she writes it on the photo in permanent marker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the french teacher solicits her understanding, she responds with comprehension; rather than say what the passage says, she just says what the passage says. When the horse dies, she recalls all the images of the horse and reports what she sees, but says nothing of the horse. When she learns to read faces, she transposes one image (the name of the emotion, written in marker) onto another (the photograph of her face). This, I gather, is what is meant by thinking in pictures. But while its material might be peculiar, its referenciality is not. Reading faces is mundane and intuitive, but it depends upon referents. Grandin's autistic outsiderness to things usually taken for granted makes the character a screen on which to explore the philosophic anxieties of these automatic, learned fluencies. Can you tell if a face is faking? What is reading besides reciting the words on the page? Where do the dead go?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, she's just as much used to tie these problems up neatly, sentimentally, and messily to the degree the solutions are neat: Yes Faces Contain Emotions That Can Be Read Right Off Them, The Dead Live On In Our Minds. (As for how reading does or does not become understanding, it's never addressed again, just hangs there.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite not being able to interpret the nuances of others' faces, her face is transparent enough to compile the labelled photographic index of her expressions. This kind of  transparency is what Claire Danes says she relies upon. In &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/09/19/161346960/claire-danes-playing-bipolar-is-serious-business"&gt;a recent interview&lt;/a&gt; she's asked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Her face--your face--changes four or five times, smiling radiantly, and then she's frowning and anxious, and then she smiles again, and then she frowns again. It's happening so quickly. It's really impressive and I wonder did you consciously do that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, there's no way that I could be conscious of that. I focus on the intention of the character and whatever thoughts and feelings she's having, and they seem to kind of naturally communicate themselves on the face.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for thoughts and feelings to naturally communicate themselves, she has to train herself. For her role as Carrie Mathison, she says she did a lot of ressearch--she watched &amp;quot;manic confessionals&amp;quot; on youtube. Only after consuming enough of these mannerisms, overlaying images upon images, does anything become natural. Implicitly she's denying that there is any theatricality in her reproductions of mannerisms. In the same interview she tells us how at an early age she didn't take a job acting in a soap, because &amp;quot;I didn't want to develop bad habits.&amp;quot; Acting that relies on conventions to communicate emotion is second-grade for her, so she takes her material from non-actors. It's true that plenty of mannerisms do not make it to television, but I know my repertoire of mannerisms includes no small share of television characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Danes' mannerisms are as particular to her as they are to her sources, like speaking a second langauge with an accent. After long enough watching her--or anyone--her mannerisms begin to lose their import, and I'm back to a semblance of Grandin's assembled problem of assembly: what's behind a face?&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/1136213364022136479/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/01/faces.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1136213364022136479'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1136213364022136479'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/01/faces.html' title='Reading(,) Faces'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-874670820052111215</id><published>2013-01-04T01:17:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2013-01-04T01:38:42.073-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>Les Miserables</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I was kindly given a vegan chocolate cup filled with raspberry sorbet. The chocolate had cayenne and cinnamon, and the whole thing tasted of freezer burn--two interchangeable statements, both to be expected from self-conscious vegan food. But I did eat it. I even ate it when its provider wasn't in the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it rankled. Couldn't I just enjoy something? I had just fled faces that fill the screen, contort with feeling like a lemon being squeezed of every drop, and never look into the camera, and the only semblance of release I can get is an equally misdirected dessert? That's the trouble with leaving--it just haunts you. I wouldn't say that I kept thinking about it. More that the anxiety of Hugh Jackman or Russel Crowe's imminent and unrelenting voices would not let up. It was as if I might turn around, and there in the corridor one of them would be, warbling and belting the least lyrical lyrics. &amp;quot;My name is Javert and you will not forget me,&amp;quot; barks Crowe, looking somewhere in the sky, is his chest bulgy as ever but seemingly not in the service of his vocal chords. If they're not not-singing flat exposition, they're unloading hyperbolic sentiments to a contextless plane of full-frame faces. Faces faces faces faces. Cinema could be regarded as an elaborate apparatus to facilitate our fascination with faces, so there may be something primal in all this--perhaps that is why it is so hard to actually look at the screen, at the actors exerting themselves so very hard. But the medium cannot support this anti-slyness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where is the voyeurism? I sometimes make fun of serial TV dramas for making  a convention of implication, but whatever--at least it's fun to feel as if you're putting things together. All of this transparency makes it impossible to see anything. If parties consisted of people being politely given their turn to tell us their deepest (read: simplest) convictions, and cry their eyes out if they like, there would be no intrigue to mitigate the abjection and discomfort of parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the second movie I've walked out of in the past month, and I've only seen three movies in the theater in that time. I'm beginning in to get paranoid. Can I handle movies anymore? They didn't used to be things I had to recover from. Bad movies are generally still enjoyable to watch at some level. They at least go down the gullet. Some apparently managed to get &lt;em&gt;Killing Them Softly&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Les Miserables&lt;/em&gt; down without choking. I wonder if I should bother going to the movies anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/874670820052111215/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/01/les-miserables.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/874670820052111215'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/874670820052111215'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/01/les-miserables.html' title='Les Miserables'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-1556763300367418056</id><published>2013-01-01T22:13:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2013-05-16T16:21:12.619-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='There Is Only Memoir'/><title type='text'>There and Not There</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Loosely covered in foil, pale with months of freezer burn, there is a pan of pesto. Most of the space is filled with bags of peaches. I put in a bag of tamales a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been known to leave parties without warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a paper shopping bag of fabric scraps and a rice cooker box filled with 35mm camera equipment. There is a dusty painting of an ideology long abandoned, its canvas canted atop large, empty 3-ring binders. There is a light grey jacket on a hanger. Its fabric crinkles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The object of leaving a party is twofold: to be known for it, and to leave the party. It is to see the stars, and to be seen seeing the stars. The audience is not necessarily there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is there, however, is a whole salmon, two-years frozen, kept from smelling, guts kept in. There, too, is a user directory from a computer seven years dead. There are photos downloaded from the Internet. There is a game that may be played but is not. There is a drawer of discarded clothing. There is a box of butter wrappers for greasing pans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the party is left behind, it begins again. Events that were not events come under scrutiny. During the party, life outside the party comes alive. Outside, the party comes alive. Neither &amp;quot;outside&amp;quot; nor &amp;quot;alive&amp;quot; are the right words. Perhaps &amp;quot;below&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;up,&amp;quot; because whether at or away from the party, there is always a mole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a wooden tortilla press. To use it, plastic wrap must be put between the wood and the uncooked tortilla.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/1556763300367418056/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/01/there-and-not-there.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1556763300367418056'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1556763300367418056'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2013/01/there-and-not-there.html' title='There and Not There'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-1856726380410380329</id><published>2012-12-23T14:14:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2013-05-16T16:21:12.621-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='There Is Only Memoir'/><title type='text'>The Holidays</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;It's that time of the year when people talk about the time of year. The other day I overheard two women telling each other all the things they like about &amp;quot;the holiday season.&amp;quot; Under what circumstances does one make an effort to list the good qualities of a thing? &amp;quot;But what I really love,&amp;quot; one said, &amp;quot;is the lights.&amp;quot; The best she had to say was the very quality this season most glaringly lacks (pun intended). The sun sets at five, and we have a &amp;quot;lights festival.&amp;quot; These semantic sleights make me worry about the psyche of my pale ancestors. Northern Europeans seem of necessity a confused lot. I can't help but think, stuck in the holiday vortex, that the idea of sin must've come from this same twisted seasonal logic--if the darkest time of year is the best time of year, then summer must be the worst. Heat and light are luxuries that we must not indulge in, lest we be miserable the other half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So these are &amp;quot;the holidays&amp;quot;; we get through the dark by inflicting our company on each other as a kind of good cheer. In this, too, it is a time of contradictions. We have the movie cliche that &amp;quot;you shouldn't be alone on Christmas,&amp;quot; yet it is a time when friends confide how miserable they and their company are. It is time of gift-giving, but because of this it is also a time of such monumental consumption that shops run out things that during any other part of the year they would have coming out of their ears. It is a time of plenty, and therefore a time of scarcity. It is when those of us with disposable incomes give to &amp;quot;those less fortunate,&amp;quot; so that we can forget about fortune the rest of the year. It is a time of relaxation, yet notoriously a time of extreme stress. It is a time of feasting, and therefore it is a time of crowds tripping over each other in the supermarket, glaring at each other for taking the last carton of egg nog. Which, like holiday beer (pumpkin) and holiday coffee (candy cane latte), is a contradiction of a commodity: something so gross you can't sell it the rest of the year. It's also a tautology: because its desirability is time-limited, it becomes more desirable. It's like a dog that lives for two months. It might smell of its own feces, but you love that dog. It's going to die soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The holiday split runs deep. I complain about the darkness, but I make it worse by waking up at noon. I make fun of looking forward to the lights in the dark, but I sometimes walk at night just to see the lights in the fog. I think the succession of holiday gatherings resemble nothing so much as a gauntlet, but I look forward to seeing those I don't otherwise see much. But does one see them? Egg nog is drinkable because it, like everything else during the holidays, is caught in the specular mediation of the season. Everything reflects back as the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/1856726380410380329/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/12/the-holidays.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1856726380410380329'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1856726380410380329'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/12/the-holidays.html' title='The Holidays'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-5516934378057762508</id><published>2012-12-13T04:54:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2013-05-16T16:21:12.627-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='There Is Only Memoir'/><title type='text'>If</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;If you sleep early, will you wake up early?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you bake the dough, will it rise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a word is German and you speak English, is the word funny?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you eat something that is &amp;quot;versunken,&amp;quot; what happens?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are onboard ship at night, are there lights?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there are lights at night, are you onboard a ship?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are onboard a ship and nobody else thinks so, how old are you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you move while others do not, are you moved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not moved, do you move?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If, while onboard, you pass an iceberg, does it wave?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the ship strikes an iceberg, does the iceberg break?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the iceberg breaks, did the iceberg strike the ship?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If an iceberg does strike the ship, does the ship move?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the ship moves, do you notice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the ship does not move, is it sturdy, or is it sunk?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you go inside, is it cold or are you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you put on a coat, are you more free?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are hot blooded, do your nerves work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If an iceberg felt, would the arctic ocean feel warm?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the ocean felt, which would feel pride of the other: the iceberg, or the ocean?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one were proud, would the other hate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we are globally warmer, is there more iceberg birthing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are warm in bed, are icebergs breaking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one does not break, will you sleep?&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/5516934378057762508/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/12/if.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/5516934378057762508'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/5516934378057762508'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/12/if.html' title='If'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-5014333650023342031</id><published>2012-12-11T00:49:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-12-11T01:37:20.079-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Apple Cake</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;The older you get, the more of a pedant you become. You start saying &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; to describe yourself. You repeat the same point over and over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every recipe is more than a record. There's always something that needs tweaking. You write the recipe you'll make next time--the ideal recipe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following recipe began by following &lt;a href="http://www.joepastry.com/2011/apfelkuchen-recipe/"&gt;Joe Pastry's recipe for Apfelkuchen&lt;/a&gt;. It was too much like cake. Too vanilla, too soggy from embedded apple chunks, not enough intensity. &amp;quot;You didn't add cinnamon?&amp;quot; asked she whose birthday cake had had cinnamon. She later revealed that her cake-baker also covered the cake in caramel sauce, after I had begun caramelizing my cakes, because anything without caramel is lacking, because caramel is a centripetal locus, like &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0029432/"&gt;Jordan Catalano&lt;/a&gt; unsexily describes penetrative sex. This description hovers in ahistoricity. I'll be forward about how this recipe came together: a Google image search for apfelkuchen, an image of a thin square cake with all the apples on top, a cupcake pan that was uncovered by a kitchen cleanse (not mine), a pan of syrup left on the stove for too long, a scourge of lemon gigantism at the supermarket. It turns out cupcakes are difficult to get liquid caramel to stick to, as they are shaped like hills, so all the caramel ends up in rivers going into an ocean in the most unfortunate place: the flat space between the cupcakes. Flat pan then. Also turns out cake flour doesn't exist any more, or it does, but for $5 a pound, so really it doesn't, and that whole wheat pastry flour is not much like cake flour, tastes strongly, and lends a dandruffy texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would not advise adding two tablespoons of cinnamon instead of one. I just had a piece, and it left a flavor of wood. Cinnamon is the bark of a tree, you counter. Yes, but we ought not to be reminded of this. That's the whole point of spices, maybe the whole point of baking--to transform ingredients into something forgetful of its roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 lbs. apples (half golden delicious, half granny smith)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2/3 cups sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 lemons' juice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peel and core the apples. Slice each apple quarter into lengthwise thirds. Fourths if they're particularly large apples. Collect the slices in a large bowl. Pour sugar over them. Cut the lemons in half and juice them into the bowl. Wait an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;9 oz. all-purpose flour (really do measure it if possible, otherwise, Joe Pastry says &amp;quot;scant 1 3/4 cups&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 tbsp. butter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 large eggs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2/3 cups buttermilk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2/3 cups milk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2/3 cups sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 lemons' zest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 tsp. baking powder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/2 tsp. salt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 tbsp. cinnamon powder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/2 tsp. cloves powder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 tsp. ground nutmeg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preheat the oven to 375 F. Beat together the butter (soften it if it isn't soft) and the sugar in a large bowl. Add the cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg. Zest the lemon halves and add the zest. Whisk in the eggs until smooth. Add flour, baking powder, and salt, and mix until fully combined. Add buttermilk and milk, and mix until smooth (I used a fork, then a whisk). Pour into a buttered 9x12 rectangular pan. Shake to level the batter. Arrange apple slices gently on top of the batter (do not push them down). Conserve the juice in the apple bowl. Bake for roughly 45 minutes, or sometime after a fork comes out clean and before the sides burn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glaze&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About fifteen minutes after putting the cake in, pour the juice from  the apple bowl into a small pot (scrape the bottom of the bowl to get all the sugar out). Bring it to a boil on high heat and then reduce to medium-low heat. Take it off the heat to check it every five minutes. When it has just turned medium brown, remove it from the heat. This should be about ten minutes before the cake is done. Take the cake out of the oven, pour the caramel evenly over it, and put it back into the oven until done. If all this timing is too aggravating, just make the glaze after the cake is done. I'm not sure baking the glaze for ten minutes makes any difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sxLdtY0c_VQ/UMbUPCPUb8I/AAAAAAAAEoQ/4yHwRfe_Ilw/s512/IMG_3918.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear:right; float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="512" width="342" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sxLdtY0c_VQ/UMbUPCPUb8I/AAAAAAAAEoQ/4yHwRfe_Ilw/s512/IMG_3918.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/5014333650023342031/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/12/apple-cake.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/5014333650023342031'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/5014333650023342031'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/12/apple-cake.html' title='Apple Cake'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sxLdtY0c_VQ/UMbUPCPUb8I/AAAAAAAAEoQ/4yHwRfe_Ilw/s72-c/IMG_3918.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-7322110155906761944</id><published>2012-12-05T22:24:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2012-12-08T22:42:42.185-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>Au Contraire</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://bitedribble.wordpress.com/2012/10/27/in-which-we-plumb-the-depths-of-ayudha-pooja/"&gt;Sneha writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have our thumbs to thank for, er, our computers. In return we've given them hardly anything to do on the QWERTY keyboard, but that's another matter for a more facetious discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And reminds me of something I've been thinking about, or actually repeating myself about, rather like the key in question. It's not really a key, though, is it? It's called a &amp;quot;bar.&amp;quot; You may call this mere semantics, but there is at the least a mechanical difference between it and the rest of the keys. I'll begin there, sneaking up with the most timid kind of evidence, the kind that doesn't make me sound like an airhead, because my head's down there in the real stuff of tiny metal hinges and little finicky plastic bits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple months ago my harem of aging laptops had finally all become really, truly unusable--one no longer transmitted video signal to its own screen or to an external monitor, another mysteriously stopped booting, and the last shut down at random (that special Apple ailment), and I had to get a new one. (As if I weren't excited about it.) The three dead laptops begat three more, aka I bought three laptops in quick succession, sending them back one by one--except the last of course. Anyway, the point is that the first one had a faulty spacebar, which was the most aggravating key to be broken--it's the one most used. I really did not want to send the laptop back, though, so I opened up the key to see if it could be fixed. I discovered that the spacebar, unlike every other key, is actually two key mechanisms under one key. The problem with mine was that one of the two mechanisms was broken, which made it pretty much impossible. It had to be pressed (or in the idiom of spacebars, hit) at just the right place to register a press (or more properly, a stroke--excuse me, I have to take a moment). One does not want to have to think to hit the spacebar. It's supposed to be the easiest key to hit, specifically designed to present a wide area whose entirety, even the very edges, is interactable. It's like an eject button. Wait, I'm getting ahead of myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting back to Sneha's assertion, I find it thoroughly opposable. Hardly anything to do? They seperate words! The strange digits that allow us to grasp have been functionally separated from the rest of the fingers on the QWERTY keyboard. Like the thumb that hits it, the spacebar is opposed with letters to make words possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is therefore a vague logic in the spacebar being the traditional pause button for computer video players. What I've been thinking about, or at least doing a lot, is hitting pause. It's a different thing, watching movies and television by myself on a laptop. I react in ways I wouldn't with company or in a theater. I don't mean I react more genuinely; one is still company. In private I use the spacebar constantly. Television especially is full of awkward moments, and unlike life, I can stop them. In an odd way, how often I pause it, un-fullscreen it, and switch frantically from tab to tab until I realize that I actually want to keep watching anyway, only to pause it again ten seconds later, represents how involved I am in the show. Of course, embarassment for the characters is not the only reason to pause a show. There is also sheer excitement (a difficult emotion to bear, really), sudden, uncomfortable parallels to my life, and just phrases and words that happen to trigger a memory. In other words, all the internal pitfalls that are always possible, but usually there is no spacebar. Of course, even without the possibility of pausing, the unbearable moments break up experience, create a before and an after. One does one thing or thinks one way or feels one way before, another after, and then, sooner or later, the same thing again, a bit differently. Shit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/12/au-contraire.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7322110155906761944'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7322110155906761944'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-1200177108564963304</id><published>2012-12-04T17:11:00.003-08:00</published><updated>2012-12-04T18:38:32.847-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>Killing Them Softly</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Laura Mulvey once declared war on pleasure. She observed that criticism takes pleasure in what it critiques. Specifically, feminist criticism of phallocentric cinema, but it's no less true in general. Her call for the cinematic destruction of pleasure is a fascinating experiment, but takes a bit too seriously, I think, the psychoanalytic idea that there is one libido, and it is male. It's good for necessary apocalyptic pronouncements of the maleness of the universe, but I don't really think it's true. However, the notion that criticism is inherently complicit by virtue of the enjoyment that makes it possible, I've taken as a given until now. My writing on film has often been excessive in carrying out this principle, overprocessing pleasure into negative pleasure through denial. It is a kind of egomania. I anxiously sought anything I could eviscerate, but I enjoyed myself in the theater, for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I got past the initial dry chuckles of watching petty criminals carry out a completely idiotic robbery, and the sledgehammer-subtle snippits of Obama and Bush speeches on the financial crisis, there was nothing fun about &lt;em&gt;Killing Them Softly&lt;/em&gt;. Nor was there anything passably benign; it became actively unpleasant to watch, and not in a meaningful way. It was at once the expression and antithesis of Mulvey's cinematic ideal: devoid of pleasure and unremittingly male. The latter is true literally (it fails the Bechdel test spectacularly), but also in that the attitude the film takes up in relation to the world is a very particular form of masculinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Peep Show&lt;/em&gt;, David Mitchell's character describes porn as &amp;quot;dead eyed men fucking dead eyed women in a desperate world of pain.&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Killing Them Softly&lt;/em&gt; is dead eyed men killing dead eyed men in a desperate world of pain. Except--and here is its particularity--it's not desperate. There is no urgency. The pervasive, unwavering affect of this world is what would be the result of a social experiment: what if a group of straight men were stuck in a locked room together with no television or alcohol? All the characteristic defenses are here: this special kind of dullness, in which there is no emotional register, and in which visual phenomena, however gruesome, hold a numbing fascination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the camera, that is. I was either bored and fidgeting or uncomfortable and fidgeting. Uncomfortable when a man gets beaten half to death, and bored by everything else. These kinds of discomforts are exactly what the film's aesthetic defends against. Indeed, the men's reactions toward each other are boredom or discomfort. There is one loving relationship, between the two dunces that Pitt is after. One of them picks up the other at the airport, and upon seeing the Australian's characteristic grease and filth, he says &amp;quot;you dirty dog!&amp;quot; It's sweet, but the camera must view it from very far away, and they must die. Otherwise, only boredom and discomfort. When the robbers hold up a high-stakes card game, they're uncomfortable, and the jaded card players, bored. The men nonengage with each other in the same way the film nonengages with its subjects. In conversation they maintain such a disinterest in each other, filmed so disinterestedly, that I can't help but be disinterested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does hold interest to uncomfortable straight men trying not to look at each other is violence. The camera gives it to us unabridged, and because sometimes that's not enough, also in slow motion. The more intense, the more it is slowed, so that its newtonian characteristics may be seen, so that it may be aestheticized like nature photography--as arrangements of form and color. In this mechanism, which is characteristic of the film's gaze, disturbance is not dealt with by looking away or by feeling an emotional supplement, but deadened by looking so intensely that it cannot be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judging from the title's place in a line of dialogue--&amp;quot;I like to kill them softly, from a distance&amp;quot;--this distancing is probably the point, but after about an hour of it, I had to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In part, it was the sound design. When Brad Pitt sat down with… hm, I actually didn't know what his role or name was--anyway they're in a restaurant with soft classical music with all the warmth taken out of it, and my fidgeting escalated to code red and I found it difficult to look at the screen or listen to the words coming out of their mouths. The theater was empty besides my dad and I, but I had to work up courage for a few minutes to ask him &amp;quot;do you want to stay?&amp;quot; He said no, not really, but he didn't get up and so neither did I, yet. We sat through five minutes of Pitt shooting someone in the head in slow motion, then we left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At home I kept thinking &amp;quot;oh god,&amp;quot; hopeful for some catharsis now that I wasn't stuck in that theater anymore. But instead everything remained dull. The movie's pointlessly bleak outlook seemed to have infected me. Nothing held any pleasure. I writhed around in bed trying to write about it, getting sick of thinking about it, and trying to distract myself from it, finally turning to &lt;em&gt;My So-Called Life&lt;/em&gt;, which I had stayed up until 5 AM the previous night with. There, Brad Pitt was a hunk to fantasize about, rather than the kind of pretensious star who only stars in &amp;quot;important&amp;quot; movies like that which I had fled. But not even that show, which had mesmerized me for many hours before, could hold my attention or elicit any emotion. I had a headache. Things were happening on the screen, but it was as if somewhere in front of the screen, it was still dead-eyed men killing dead-eyed men. Everything was just visual phenomena. All that I could do was sit through it, until, eventually, it all began to mean something again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/1200177108564963304/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/12/killing-them-softly.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1200177108564963304'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1200177108564963304'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/12/killing-them-softly.html' title='Killing Them Softly'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-764401880956696373</id><published>2012-11-30T19:24:00.003-08:00</published><updated>2012-11-30T23:43:48.388-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>What is in a Name</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Presentation isn't everything, but sometimes it tells too much. When a dessert is presented as an upscale soft-serv twirl of whipped cream with a peacock's tail of green apple slices, you have good cause to worry. Of course, you could have just as easily been tipped off by another presentation that is best left free of fluff--the name: Italian apple cream tart. One thing jumps out: Italian? If there's anything Italian about it, we might be trusted to recognize it. And if not, so what?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One ought to be leery of any restaurant that has a vested interest in the nominal ethnicity of its food. &amp;quot;Italian restaurant and grill&amp;quot; will do; specifying that each dish is indeed Italian is not only redundant, but troubling. What makes a tart Italian? Not to worry, this mystery was revealed to me with the first bite. Sogginess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the pleasures of pastry is the contrast between the filling--wet, smooth, sweet--and the crust--dry, flaky, a bit salty. Replacing the crust with stale cake shows a lack of understanding, not to mention appreciation, of the nature of a tart. So maybe, despite its name, it isn't a tart, but just a very confused, cylindrical trifle comprised of whipped cream, apple mush, and dense, buttery cake. Wait, a trifle wouldn't have such a rich cake. Eschewing categories is fine, but experiments put on a menu I think should at least taste good enough to justify themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm becoming more of a staunch traditionalist with every sentence, and accordingly I ordered the least adventurous thing on the menu--bolognese. We know what that is, right? Encouragingly, the menu did not call it &amp;quot;Italian bologense&amp;quot;, and even describes it: &amp;quot;slow-cooked meat sauce.&amp;quot; In other words, it's a ragù, with additions of cream and wine. Simple enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calling something Italian is misguided, but at least I understand why it's done. The pasta dish that arrived plunged me into a crisis in the philosophy of language that until that moment I never took seriously: How do words connect with things? The ground beef mixed with vodka sauce before me suggested an answer, too: They don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have been to Cicily's (the name says everything, doesn't it?), you might rightfully wonder why I expected anything but exactly what I got from a restaurant in a shopping center. Such places are not concerned with food, but with purveying class markers. They're where the middle class comes to feel high class. But I am an unrealistic utopian. Mood lighting, glitzy bars, and muzak can coexist with decent food. Who's with me?&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/764401880956696373/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/11/what-is-in-name.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/764401880956696373'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/764401880956696373'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/11/what-is-in-name.html' title='What is in a Name'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-5085335111060994351</id><published>2012-11-30T01:58:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2013-05-16T16:21:12.625-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='There Is Only Memoir'/><title type='text'>Darkrooms</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;It's almost a decade too late to mourn film photography, but yesterday I was given a clutch of exposed black and white rolls. Their contents are a mystery. There are enough of them that I considered buying new bottles of chemicals, retreating to the bathroom at night, and plugging the gaps with towels. Even though I have the time, it seemed like too much of an ordeal, too risky (I've ruined rolls of film before), and it's all just going to end up digital anyway. At this point, developing my own negatives just to scan them would be an affectation, and not something I would ever do again. While I still have a film camera somewhere in my closet, why buy film for it and go to the trouble of developing the film when I can take digital photos?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possibly because one doesn't have to be a utilitarian; the goal of photography is technically an image, but its draws are many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, film photography can only be approached via nostalgia--the conviction that the older the thing, the more real and the more beautiful it is. When I did a lot of dark room work, however, was the transition period during which the technical superiority of digital photography wasn't yet established. Even professional digital cameras weren't yet as high resolution as 35mm film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darkroom developing was taught in high school. Maybe it still is--what is taught there is less knowledge than discipline, which darkrooms require a lot of. I didn't take the class; my prints were sloppy. I wasn't so interested in the meticulous work that photography brandishes as a sign of its artistry. Not because I had anything against work as self-justification, but because I was lazy and I was a stubborn autodidact, which really just meant I relied on other channels. I was taught by friends who had taken the class, so for me photography was about belonging, intimacy, and conversely, solitude. Taking photos I was an obsessive, nitpicking aesthete, but in the darkroom I was a romantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be a mean place, though, waiting in the dark. In my makeshift arrangement in the bathroom, you couldn't open the door while film is developing. It could take about ten minutes. It's a long ten minutes, sitting in on the floor, listening to the timer tick. That lengthening of time was exactly what I wanted. It's a ritual; there is a great deal of preparation, and certain elements that must be in place. I learned these elements from the same friends who taught me the technical parts, and carried them to my time with myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the contours of this practice's dissemination I detect a whiff of adolescent sexuality; having no similar experience to corroborate this intuition, I can only conclude that the scent is that of an &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of how adolescents get ideas about sex. Nonetheless, there was something erotic about developing photos with company. There was no physical contact, but there was the possibility of touch, or rather, touch diffused. The dark both depressurizes one's sense of inhabiting a discrete body, and heightens the awareness of sensation. A darkroom is not without light, but the lights illuminate photos, not people. Gazes do not meet, but fall on the images made by projector lamp or slowly accumulating dim and red on wet paper. In a room where all attention is on images, the sensuality of the dark becomes like the colorful static you see in the absence of light--atmospheric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing I learned was that above all there must be music. A darkroom is as evocative a place to listen to music as a moving car, but in a different way. Rather than propelling, the music soaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the music, like the dark, can grate. I once boasted that if I were punished with being locked alone in a room for hours, I would actually enjoy it. &amp;quot;Yes, you would,&amp;quot; they said, but the truth was that I did this to myself regularly, and it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; punishment. It had the same volatility that any extended period alone with your thoughts and few distractions does. &amp;quot;Nonstop you,&amp;quot; the Lufthansa slogan that for Elif Batuman &amp;quot;seems to encapsulate the full horror and nausea of human consciousness,&amp;quot; is, for the same reason, a good descriptor of being in a darkroom alone. Thankfully, there is one distraction from you, which is the work you do there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always hoped that the time would be meditative, which it rarely was. I remember either trying just to get it over with and having to turn off the music, which irritated me, or being caught in a high that teetered between euphoria and anger. Things can easily go wrong in a darkroom, and when your expectations are sky high, overexposing a print can be cause for cursing. I'm not a graceful person, and excitement makes one even clumsier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More often, though, my moodiness in there had little to do with what I did or did not do. It was simply that there--like the minutes before sleep--you remember things you would otherwise not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more familiar you become with darkroom technique, the more you work in your imagination. I did a lot of trial and error, the imperfect results of which stuck around, and cost. Eventually, you get better at estimating contrast filters and exposure timings. On a computer you can do anything, you don't have to pay for paper, and the results are immediately visible. Delay defined the darkroom. Imagination lives in the often frustrating place where it cannot be realized, and Photoshop has made everything easier. Which is what I'm going to use to turn the developed negatives into positives, thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/5085335111060994351/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/11/darkroom-vicissitude.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/5085335111060994351'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/5085335111060994351'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/11/darkroom-vicissitude.html' title='Darkrooms'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8933170539974165439</id><published>2012-11-25T01:24:00.004-08:00</published><updated>2012-11-25T01:24:35.452-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Beers Queued At Your Feet</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;In Clue, you must travel from room to room. Each turn you must leave a room, enter a room, or make progress between rooms. You can't stay in the same room, even when you're certain it is the right room. The game requires you not to give away your certainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some players of clue hmm significantly, others throw sidelong glances that appear sly to the degree that they aren't. These acts make a theater of thinking, but are adjacent to thinking. Adjacent, yet sometimes you find yourself looking hard at your notepad, as if looking hard forces deductions from check marks to avail themselves, or as if deductions furrow the brow. It isn't clear there are deductions at all, yet a certain arbitrary boldness of logic often seems necessary to play. You look at everyone's movements as if they're significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are movements more or less significant after two beers? Principally, these movements are to enter beers into the beer app. Principally, these beers are drank to enter them into the beer app. At least, so the drinkers claim. If there is suspicion about the drinkers' motives, only consider your ambivalence towards Life, which--third beer--is what you're now playing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already you appear to be roughly 50, according to your position on the board. You have passed all the forks, at each of which you may take the longer path or the shorter path. You took all the shorter ones, finished second, and ended with the second most money. Your score is how much money you end with. You thought it was better (in the game) to go as slowly as possible, to accumulate as many Life chips as possible to cash in at the end. But going faster--which somehow reduces your chances to get into costly accidents--appears to be more lucrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However little time Life takes to complete, it is a boring game, and you often get distracted. You forget to take a pay day or two. You fiddle with the beer app. Was that beer a two or a three? Would you recommend it? Your friend toasts you, or rather toasts your addition and rating of the beer, or rather your friend pushes a button, across the table. It is unclear what the difference is between this act and the clinking of glasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a large bag of chips. The players crunch, slide pieces, spin dials, roll dice, drink. Each time you grab a handful of chips from the bag, you imagine it will be all you'll need. This turns out to be true, for a short period of time. The period gets shorter when there are not other actions available. The game is a distraction from chips; the chips are a distraction from the game. Distraction: stopgap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the chips run out, the drinkers have another reason, besides unlocking the acheivement of drinking 12 beers of the same brand. They can't enter that they have drank these beers without having drank them. What makes games fun is rules. Does following those rules also make the game fun?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fun and useful are different; the beer app mixes. (Minimally) fun choices taken in game are paralleled by useful choices out of game. Then again, are short paths fun and reticence, useful? Actually, ending the game soon seems safe, and safety, ruinous.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/8933170539974165439/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/11/beers-queued-at-your-feet.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8933170539974165439'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8933170539974165439'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/11/beers-queued-at-your-feet.html' title='Beers Queued At Your Feet'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-6361453350865038025</id><published>2012-11-22T15:34:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-11-22T15:52:49.024-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>Homeland's Lightning Rod</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I've given up editing this. Writing demands that you believe in something which is ultimately flawed. This is a problem of time, of stretching the moment of first draft before it gives way to editing (&lt;a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/palimpsest-city/"&gt;as Teju Cole puts it&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;writing lives or dies by what’s produced in that moment&amp;quot;), yes. But it is also a problem of reconciling mania and depression. Isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideas only sound like good ideas to someone who is out of touch with their own limitations and the limitations of the world. Indeed, the necessary belief in the communicative possibility of writing isn't quite on. I write this because I think a someone might read it and understand. It's a gambit for recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which surely is not always a delusional wish? It's hard to judge. The labelling of mental illnesses gives the appearance that distinctions between sanity and insanity can be clearly drawn--that one can judge. But if the afflicted's problem is conceived as one of judgement, only semantic hocus-pocus can be offered. As advice from one bipolar person to another, &amp;quot;there's good gut and there's bad gut; sometimes I really have to clean out the fridge and set it on fire--that's bad gut&amp;quot; is perfectly opaque. This is what Carrie's father tells her in &lt;em&gt;Homeland&lt;/em&gt; when she's in the middle of a manic episode and she tells him something she really &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to do. His advice seems to suggest she is capable of both precognitive retrospection and seeing herself from outside herself (which are basically the same thing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She spends the worst of her mania holed up in her sister's house under constant supervision, away from messy stimuli and eyes who would see her craziness. While she's being reigned in, the boundaries blur. Her &amp;quot;condition&amp;quot; gets her fired; her employment depended upon the relative control medication offered her. Yet her brilliance as an intelligence operative is clearly related to her bipolarity. While she's manic she does some of her best work, albeit in a nearly incomprehensible manner. She becomes a kind of Cassandra, subject to bursts of insight that nobody believes. Her friend and father figure, Saul, though, is able to put it all together, to provide the translation. She idealizes their relationship as one might a family in an earlier era: a refuge of love in an unforgiving world (Langley, in this case). His complaint is that he does most of the foriving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is in general someone who lets her burdens fall on others. She uses her sister to provide her with the experimental drugs that allow her to function at her job, and falls back on her sister's care whenever she immediately needs it. There is therefore a perverse moralism in others' burdens being displaced onto her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It strikes me that this characterizes well my relationship with myself in the process of writing, and that while depressed it's not that insight isn't possible, but that it always sounds like &amp;quot;bad gut.&amp;quot; While my upswings are nowhere near Carrie's nor my mother's manias, they are productive to the same degree that they are foolish. While my decisions are less drastic than setting the fridge on fire or accusing someone of planning to blow up the vice president, they do nonetheless seem very wrong in retrospect. Which sounds, if you ask me, like the structure of consciousness, rather than a bipolar pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her dad tut-tuts her for staying up late working, she retorts &amp;quot;I feel pretty great.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Wired. There's a difference.&amp;quot; It's hard to deny the distinction--there are different kinds of happiness--however, he's not distinguishing among a field, but putting the one above the rest. The one is that calm, enduring, enlightened happiness waiting at the end of therapeutic narratives. It's that much touted and aestheticized in-the-momentness. At the very least, this ideal state does not characterize American nationalism, whose Homeland Security overcompensates for the wrongness of 9/11. Carrie along with it, as we are reminded every episode by her saying &amp;quot;I missed something ten years ago, I can't let that happen again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where is the wrongness in the right and the rightness in the wrong? This is what &lt;em&gt;Homeland&lt;/em&gt; is concerned with, and how interiority is so obsessively cultivated there as a mystery between contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supreme contradiction is of course Brodie, the American soldier who is an impassioned anti-American terrorist. When he finally gets caught by the CIA, Carrie calls the eight years of torture and intimacy that created his passion &amp;quot;brainwashing,&amp;quot; which means, as far as I can tell, &amp;quot;brainwashing that isn't ours.&amp;quot; She uses this term despite knowing that the boy Brodie babysat for three years died in an American drone strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the first season of &lt;em&gt;Homeland&lt;/em&gt; I wanted Brodie to blow up the vice president (who ordered said drone strike). This isn't just out of a need for violence, or even just a need for a break in the binds that Carrie and Brodie increasingly inhabit. The show puts us in this position because if Brodie suicide bombs himself, he vindicates Carrie's reasoning, which we know to be sound. If he doesn't go through with it, nobody will know that she's right. That he ultimately thinks better of it is crueler (and therefore more pleasurable) to the viewer than if he had gone through with it. Life, it turns out, is more demanding and more brutal than death. Its reproduction requires the repression of truth. For life to go on, Carrie and everyone else must believe that she's insane. In lieu of others' deaths, Carrie can only go on by consenting to electroshock therapy, which she admits will potentially cause some amnesia. &amp;quot;I can't go on like this,&amp;quot; she says to Saul, &amp;quot;after all that's happened, it's probably better that I forget.&amp;quot; And really this is what the vice president and Carrie's boss are asking of the world--to forget. &amp;quot;It's just a turd, leave it alone,&amp;quot; says the VP. This puts the viewer in an excruciating position: she's atoning for something that we know wasn't wrong. Yes, she may be &amp;quot;a little intense,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;off,&amp;quot; but her analysis is spot on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CIA in this show operates under the assumption that all policing does: that bad things are ultimately caused by bad people, and that bad things can be stopped by stopping bad people. Not to say there's really much of another option. To admit that the very life it's their job to protect is violent in its repression, and that the excesses of this repression have such fallouts as terrorism would be more or less to give up on this life. Part of protecting life, or at least national life, is to protect the illusion that others threaten it, rather than itself. When Carrie and Saul's investigation threatens to uncover the nation's (and the CIA's) complicity in an act of terrorism against it, this must be repressed. It is a threat not just to the CIA's ideology, but as Carrie's boss points out, to the nation itself. &amp;quot;You'd be handing the enemy the best recruitment tool since Abu Grabe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But uncover that aptly labelled &amp;quot;turd&amp;quot; she did, and so she must bear its burden. By the end of the first season--which comes to a close with her running around making what sound like insane accusations--she is the mad woman in the attic. Her work doesn't save the world from itself, but becomes internalized as the sign of her madness. Her relationship to the world is not to be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing ultimately fails, in part because there is no Saul to translate the intimate workings of our minds to the world. More to the point, because neither the world nor the mind is fully equipped or inclined to articulate its own undoing. That's why writing, in the peculiar and irritating sense I have meant it here, is work--because inhabiting the negligable space between living and dying is an effort. One buries the death drive so far one becomes its rushing expression, or one lets it seep into consciousness and slows nearly to a halt. Between these is not stability or sanity, but normality. There's a difference.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6361453350865038025/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/11/homelands-lightning-rod.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6361453350865038025'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6361453350865038025'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/11/homelands-lightning-rod.html' title='Homeland&apos;s Lightning Rod'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8108480214273267821</id><published>2012-11-21T02:05:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-11-21T02:05:43.998-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Turkey Nouns</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turkey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thighs.

It's even more acute, I think, than stepping into another's home. In another's cooking I can't avoid that each has their own habits, anxieties, superstitions, and turn-ons. It would seem logical to suggest that infatuation softens the perception of another's culinary peculiarities, but actually I think those peculiarities are among the most difficult to sop up with a romantic narrative. Sexy food movies have it all wrong; the kitchen is not where you fall in love, but where love is strained. It's where pet peeves exert their strongest impulse, and you're forced to realize that the other is a person, and that you might also be one. Or maybe it's just me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the same reason, if one is inclined toward psychological or anthropologic curiosity, the way another cooks is an object of fascination. The most interesting discoveries are made, as in those two fields, when one's position as an observer is most compromised. When you discover that those slices of onion are too large, that blenders are not used that way, that no not a big on salt, that hashbrowns must have the liquid squeezed from them before fried, that you must not mix anything together before everything is measured and ready, that certain ingredients are equivalent, that shrimp must be veined or you must burn in hell, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6098961988596644991/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/11/the-war-room.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6098961988596644991'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6098961988596644991'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/11/the-war-room.html' title='the war room'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-6173636966894121567</id><published>2012-11-14T12:21:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2012-11-14T13:07:59.946-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>Skyfall</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's like Home Alone!&amp;quot; my friend said, just as I was about to say the same. It went from Bond movie to &lt;em&gt;The Adventures of 007 and M&lt;/em&gt; (as they drive off to his acestral Scotland in an ancient car), and, finally, to &lt;em&gt;Home Alone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man behind us made many things better. He teased the first sex scene: &amp;quot;oh, Bond.&amp;quot; First? Only. I would say this is new, but we're not spared the flirtations of Bond and Moneypenny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of &lt;em&gt;The Wrath of Khan&lt;/em&gt; by this dogged theme of mortality. Can such things survive in a Bond movie? The suggestion that 007 might be fallible and violable was new in Daniel Craig's first Bond movie, but it remains an anomaly--one which this plot aims to dispell. In the end it's less about death--however thickly the dialogue is (&amp;quot;bloody old warships,&amp;quot; bla bla bla)--than it is about flaccidity. Jesus really failed to answer the burning question: after you're resurrected, can you maintain an erection? In Craig's case, the answer is of course--well, witness his gait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world is this genre's playground, but that's nothing new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sneaking scene of mirrors and neon in Shanghai was, however, beautiful. As is all of the scenery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, action sequences in Bond are aesthetic flourishes more than they are locuses of tension. It's not exactly that there are no rules, but rather, the impossible is the most likely course of action. Survive getting shot and falling hundreds of feet into a river? Yes. Motorcycle on rooftops? Yes. Slide down the metal barrier between opposing escalators? Well, I guess that's neither aesthetic nor impossible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reboot is these days as obligatory as the dub step trailer. But self-consciously bringing hints of realism to Bond? (Q says to Bond something like &amp;quot;it's a tube train, I know you've never been in one.&amp;quot;) Surely that's straining the genre. Which is the point, I guess. I find myself asking the question what's worse, the Bond movie tradition, or the recent attempts to shake it up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't aware that old necessarily meant conservative, but I stand corrected. Apparently, the world is a scary, scary place that can only be saved by &amp;quot;a paragon of British fortitude.&amp;quot; (If you like Judi Dench as M, you have to assume she was making fun of 007 by calling him this in his obit.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says that the villain is &amp;quot;from the same place Bond is, from the shadows.&amp;quot; Sorry, Gandalf?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;All this running around, jumping and shooting, it's so exhausting,&amp;quot; says Bardem, Assange, whatever his name is. So true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;007 takes up his father's old hunting rifle AT A FUCKING COUNTRY ESTATE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scotland = England, but &amp;quot;back in time&amp;quot; (oh god).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bardem is lovely, unfortunately he's also here the specter of the &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; world's homosexuality, threatening to penetrate all things that like to think themselves unpenetrable (MI6, Bond). &lt;strong&gt;Oh no we must repair the leak in straightness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The innuendos are really awful, as is all of the dialogue, but then, that's traditional. But then, this one wants to be taken seriously everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious sillyness, silly seriousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If by the 50-year-old scotch and the equally old car it means to say that the Bond franchise is an artifact of the 1960s, then I agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trauma narratives. At least the evil double (Bardem) laughs at his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gila monster scene was very Star Wars, my friend points out. Henchman picks up Bond's gun, which can only be fired by him, thanks to Q. He says &amp;quot;good luck with that&amp;quot;; henchman gets eaten by gila monster. I think it might even be George Lucas &amp;amp; Harrison Ford in general (it could be in Indiana Jones or Star Wars). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finale really drags. But then, as &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/11/04/021104crat_atlarge?currentPage=all"&gt;Anthony Lane points out&lt;/a&gt;, it always does in Bond movies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6173636966894121567/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/11/skyfall.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6173636966894121567'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6173636966894121567'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/11/skyfall.html' title='Skyfall'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-7714495815251297488</id><published>2012-11-02T19:10:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2012-11-02T19:10:52.575-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>Little Bags of Crisps</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just ran out of toast. There is the potential for &amp;quot;real food,&amp;quot; I guess, but why properly cook when I can buy more snacks? Detectives, it seems, agree, but they are on the other side: They have no time for anything but snacks, and so they idolize meals. Watching them, and having plenty of time to cook meals, I lust for snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm really just talking about one detective, though snacking is part of the genre. She crunches on little bags of crisps, and I salivate for all things snacky. Her face shocked me on the &lt;em&gt;Hitchcock&lt;/em&gt; poster. I tried to emulate her haircut. This too was a grass-is-greener phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had at my disposal an odd thing: a snack that I labored over for hours. I baked it because I ran out of topics that might interest a guest--ran out of talk altogether, actually--and turned the kitchen instead into a stage, where I performed Tarte Tatin. &amp;quot;Real pastry,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;good for you,&amp;quot; and went back to reading coupons on newsprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the morning came with its disappointment (consciousness) and relief (the guest gone), the previous night's labor allowed me to avoid one of morning's major groanings (cooking breakfast). All I had to do was coffee. Late afternoon came, and I ate more tart. It was not snacking in the way that chips provide an action for anxious cogitation. It was snacking in the I'm-too-lazy-to-cook way, and in its nutritional content: flour, butter, sugar (and a bit of fruit). Its rejection of all things &amp;quot;substantial.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thinks one is allaying the passage of time by refusing to spend it cooking, and by lazing around with tart, coffee, book, and computer, but now it was already dark. It was time to go, and I had not eaten anything but tart all day. I ate another piece of tart, so that I wouldn't be hungry (I would be gone for three hours).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My guts undulated. I recalled an exchange with last night's guest. &amp;quot;Not much sugar you put in, did you?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;2/3 of a cup. Lots of butter though--a whole stick in the crust, and half a stick in the filling.&amp;quot; (As if sugar and butter are interchangeable by virtue of being considered unhealthy.) There was a certain advantage, though, to filling the stomach with butter and coffee: I didn't want to put anything else in there. Guts had been inverted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are the extremes of snacking's see-saw: I either don't want to eat anything, ever, or I want to eat ALL THE SNACKS (as &lt;a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/"&gt;Hyperbole and a Half&lt;/a&gt; would put it) and to never stop. Eating is either a bother or a never-complete transubstantiation. These might sound opposed, but both are attempts not to move forward--either through outright refusal or by the rapid lateral motions of a hermit crab. Detectives snack wen the case isn't going anywhere. When they're stuck. At a narrative level, an investigation consists of long periods of frustrated stuckness and desperate grasping punctuated by sudden leaps forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meals punctuate. To eat a meal is to admit that one needs to eat, ergo to admit that time has passed since one last ate. It is especially difficult to admit that time has passed when one has done so little during that time now gone, and when one thinks that something has to be done with time, otherwise one does not deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detectives who have not cracked the case eat &amp;quot;one of those frozen chili con carne things&amp;quot; one night and &amp;quot;one of those frozen chili con carne things&amp;quot; the next night. They do not appreciate someone butting in to cook &amp;quot;proper food&amp;quot; for them. Begrudgingly they will eat what is cooked for them, but they will not allow its punctuation. The cook will get angry and leave; the detective's problem with this meal (one of many) will thus be side-stepped.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/7714495815251297488/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/11/little-bags-of-crisps.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7714495815251297488'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7714495815251297488'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/11/little-bags-of-crisps.html' title='Little Bags of Crisps'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8403959723029105741</id><published>2012-10-29T14:40:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-29T14:40:15.793-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>Cloud Atlas</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;In what universe is &amp;quot;our lives are bound with others&amp;quot; such a revelation that it's tantamount to revolution? These words are apparently so powerful in the fascist future of Neo Seoul, when society is divided into servers, consumers, seers, archivists, and other ominous-sounding, dystopian categories, that they start a religion, and the clone girl (a &amp;quot;server&amp;quot;) who speaks these words becomes its martyr. What, do the people of New Seoul not have social media, where &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; would spout such profundity daily? Do none of them have stoner friends to regale them with the mind-blowing philosophies they've worked out from the latest Wachowski film?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, because this is not a universe that bothers with such quotidia. It's a universe in which every point in history is exactly the same, while appearing vastly different. Well, that's not quite true. It cannot be said that faces appear vastly different, from era to era. Makeup artists have been tasked with the contradictory work of this universe: they must make the same look different, while being reocognizable as the same. The same actors are recycled throughout all time by the addition of putty. The awkwardness of a Korean with freckles, a ginger frizz, green eyes, and a frock is considerable, but nothing compared to the awkwardness of equating a slave's emancipation in the 19th century with a sleazy publisher's escape from a retirement home. The nuances of such comparisons, however, are not within the scope of this universe, which is nonetheless considerable, at least by appearances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, I am a hopeless enough postmodernist that I think it's cool to find the deep relation between historically disparate things. Far more specific things. The vision of the Wachowskis, or David Mitchell, or Tom Tykwer, or whoever (if we're &amp;quot;all connected&amp;quot; and the same so are they), is so grand that history is merely a colorful backdrop. The past and the far-future are the Orient. There can be no insight in these relationships between disparate points in time, because they aren't relationships; a relationship is necessarily between &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; entities. There are six stories here, all the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me be as clear as this film's vision is obscuring: the best part is the aging publisher's escape from the retirement home. (The best part is Jim Broadbent.) And I think, also, the most honest. One of my issues with the film, then, is a matter or hierarchy: all of these stories are just the publisher's amusing tale (which takes place in the present day) with different scenery, which is also the contention of matchcuts and smooth audio transitions that do more violence to time than Kubrick could have ever dreamed, but they also insist that all these tales are on an equal plane; I rather think the many all spring from one, here. As all these characters demostrate, we dream of mattering, and this is the filmmakers' way of mattering: spinning tales of consciousness-raising, of heroes using their privilege to save the underclass. Why must the universe always be saved by heroism? Why must heroes dodge bullets, perform acrobatics, vaunt peaks, and generally preen in their own transcendance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What else is it, when an author chooses to disperse a story across eons, but to say &amp;quot;look, my imagation transcends time and space&amp;quot;? I do not mark anyone for imagination, nor do I ask that history be treated sanctimoniously as if it's &amp;quot;true-true,&amp;quot; in this film's cutesy futuristic patois, but must imagination be so showy? A message does not get more profound through ventriloquism. When all the voices say exactly the same thing, why bother multiplying them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is embedded in the film's revolutionary praxis: The revolutioaries' mouthpiece must be one of the masses whose cause they champion. This is an erotic relationship, and the revolutionaries positively drool when they see Sonmi: an opportunity. Their message would not seem authentic if not spoken from the lips of its concern. Sure, diegetically these are her words, but her author needed &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; to say them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is supposedly about the triumph of love, not of authorial fantasies. Love is apparently all the same at any and every historical moment, whether between a revolutionary and a clone slave in the future in Korea, two male interbellum English aesthetes, Halle Berry and Tom Hanks--I mean a journalist and a scientist in the 1970s, Halle Berry and Tom Hanks again but in costumes that seem already to be relics of imagining the future or maybe just second-hand Star Trek, or a black slave an English man of the cloth. Sure sounds to me like a definition of love peculiar to the present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gentle, warm-hearted Christian man asks the slave &amp;quot;how do you know I'm you're friend?&amp;quot; The slave replies by pointing at his own eyes and then at his friend's eyes and saying &amp;quot;it's all you need.&amp;quot; I was quite taken by this simple truth when I saw it, but now I ask: really, is that all? And that difference between then and now is why I ask. In this universe, however, people are reliable, and most reliable in love, which is both the articulation and the constitution of their souls. Or should I say soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conviction that self and other are interconnected could be profound, if it were troubled by the consequences of relationality, rather than lubricated by all those others it obscures and squashes under its zealous, revolutionary bootheel. There is a lot of anger here about people whose personhood has been and continues to be violently denied (slaves, women, homosexuals), but the heroic fight against this oppression involves no shortage of othering, and this gives nobody pause. Faceless black-visored police enforcers in the future, monotonic secret operatives who spew racist slurs in the 1970s, belligerent landowners in the 19th century. (The only intelligible bad guy is in the present, of course: the publisher's sadistic brother, who spites him for his financial dependence, and for sleeping with his wife.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't say the death of people our historical moment despises is inconsistent with Sonmi's philosophy, but neither is the mass murder that supposedly inspires it. If death is a &amp;quot;door&amp;quot; to another life, then why should we care about clones like her being farmed like chicken? If &amp;quot;boundaries are an illusion,&amp;quot; then what does slaughter violate? It's hard to believe the fuzzy newagisms she broadcasts to the world inspired anything, much less a religion, and it's equally hard to believe that they are in any way connected to the ghastly circumstances of her life. I've heard people say similar things after merely enduring the line at the local coffee shop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this latest installment of the Wachowski's battle against The System, the thing to be brought down is &amp;quot;The Natural Order&amp;quot; (the point of this term being that it's only natural to those who privilege from it). But their issue does not appear to be that what is considered &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; tends to work in this socially determined way. The thing that's supposed to break up The Natural Order is love. But if love is destiny, transcending time and space, determined before you were born, what is that but a consolidation of what is natural?&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/8403959723029105741/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/10/cloud-atlas.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8403959723029105741'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8403959723029105741'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/10/cloud-atlas.html' title='Cloud Atlas'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-504064803436951769</id><published>2012-10-26T19:25:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-26T22:59:18.822-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='I Did Not Eat I Did Not Sleep'/><title type='text'>Windows 8 Released</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Today Microsoft gave a press conference on their release of Windows 8.

The former, obviously, is linguistic; the latter is not. The former is manic; the latter, depressive. The former does not feel exhausting but soon exhausts; the latter feels dull, even relaxing, but raises to a suppressed din of impasse. In the philosophical scene of pointing at chairs, the former is essentially solipsistic, concerned with the world only as an aesthetic backdrop; the latter--more properly philosophical--obsessed with objects that cannot be reached. The former is masturbatory; the latter, romantic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The latter is also more difficult to explain. Everyone who writes and idealizes writing is familiar with the high of phrases coming in flashes. Moreover, it has been, as you would expect, written about extensively. I have not read a word about my suburban flanerie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can only describe it by circumloctuion, in part because it mostly resides in memory. I have spend a staggering amount of time in contemplation of yards, but most of it when I was a teenager.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ever since I began attending public school (kindergarden), there has been a lot of walking in my life. I would say that my parents insisted that my brother and I walk to school, but I don't remember thinking that there were other options. That dawned on me slowly after weeks of other parents' cars flocking to the school at the finishing bell. I don't at all remember being envious. By that time the walks were an accepted part of life. If anything, I took pleasure in not having a ride, just as I used to get excited when the other kids made fun of my brown-bag lunches that often contained pumpkin pie in a ziplock bag, which resembled something that more traditionally excites and revolts children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For several years, however, I was accompanied by my brother--by protective decree, probably. In company one does not contemplate yards. Of course, the memory of the texture of my mental life at that time is sparse. I have no idea what it was like when I finally did begin walking by myself. Whimsy is certain: I remember looking up at the sky while I swung on the playground swings, wilfully inducing the illusion that the sky was down, the ground, up, and I teetering above an abyss of blue, held to the swing seat by some improbable countergravity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whatever those walks were to me, they were cut in middle school by the presence of another companion--my best friend. We lived a block from each other and so walked to school and back together. It occurs to me that I had very little time to myself (not that it was a thing to want, then) until high school. Given my current proclivities, I am tempted to ascribe a psychological cause to the near-fainting spells I had throughout middle school. Perhaps they were a symptom of early adolescence: I was just old enough to have an introverted clash with my peers, but not old enough to realize it. Instead, I spent time in the nurse's office laying down and trying not to black out. There was a certain restfulness in the white of everything there. That is where I might locate the beginnings of the contemplative noncognition that would later attach itself to yards. I spent a lot of time staring at white, letting its texture and light seep into me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For reasons I don't recall, my best friend and I didn't walk together to high school very often. Maybe our class schedules simply began to differ. In any case, I walked to and from high school, sometimes twice a day because I would flee home for lunch (the clash had reached its apex: I was terrified of campus). The route between home and high school was entirely along residential streets. So I would walk by the same houses over and over. Yet I never got used to them. I saw them change from season to season, but these changes never accrued into dynamic entities that persisted through time. No, every glance at their evocative exteriors constituted an eternity. In part this was a kind of furniture catalogue yard envy. I would look at patios and arbors and wish I had them. Other people's yards are always more appealing. It's only there, indeed, that eternity is possible. Looking at some restful corner of a yard replete with greenery and soft light, I imagine sitting there forever, life solved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a woman who lives two doors down in an enormous turn of the century homestead. Her spacious property is filled with old fruit trees, and a magnificent oak. Her name is Fader, and she does seem to. She takes very good care of her yard. I rarely see her outside, but the evidence of her care is apparent. The patches of daffodils and tulips, the mowed grass and trimmed trees, and the white benches and chairs at particularly nice spots. I have never seen her or anyone else sitting in the alluring furniture. Yet she has carefully placed it, each piece an idyll of sitting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The yardanalia (for lack of a better word) I see while walking is not always idyllic. Often, it's just strange. Cheesy, neglected statuary signals the otherness of a domestic life. Looking at it, I realize that whoever lives there passes it all the time; that it's a part of their daily life. To imagine such a life is bewildering. Of course, this life quite probably ignores its yard for the most part. Yards are only really noticed when newly reinvented or by people who don't live in them. On the one hand, objects in yards are of little significance to those who inhabit them. On the other hand, this is exactly what makes them significant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a certain pain in passing all of these artifacts of other lives. On a long enough walk, to look begins to hurt. The limits of one life become apparent. All of these lives, these singularities, these things one is not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I find myself returning to this mode of walking, I am relieved to realize it is rare, troubled to think it could continue, and concerned by its import. As soon as I've left it, I'm sad that I seem to have forgotten how to return.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6964341582610283982/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/10/the-contemplation-of-yards.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6964341582610283982'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6964341582610283982'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/10/the-contemplation-of-yards.html' title='The Contemplation of Yards'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-6555155141664350925</id><published>2012-10-21T21:32:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T21:36:37.510-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='I Did Not Eat I Did Not Sleep'/><title type='text'>A Poor Player</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Faced with the insistence that games are ruining our children, one often falls back on the insistence that games are not reality, and that players can discern the difference. While this serves its political function, it has the defensive ring of dishonesty. Games are, after all, not the only things one plays. There are those things in which one is accustomed to identifying one's personhood. Yes, one can reflect on what one plays, but that, too, is playing at something. The notion that behind all this playing is an infinite capacity to not be confused is surely only a comforting game.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There being nothing to fall back on, my attitude towards all forms of play is a senseless one: What is the point of playing? Directed towards the more difficult parts of life, this melancholic question draws me into playing computer games. But I have the same question of those games, and often it seems it's only that I can't answer this question that stops me from playing a computer game forever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I do sometimes put the question to other players of the game I'm addicted to, but they usually give answers that begin from already enjoying the game. Such is enjoyment; one does not have eyes in one's eyes. Players enthusiastic enough to haunt forums never seem to be able to explain what is compelling about playing to someone who doesn't play--or someone like me who finds the pleasures of the game inexplicable, and sometimes thinks they're not even pleasures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the winter (of course it was winter) of the year before last, I became addicted to &lt;a href="http://wl.widelands.org/"&gt;Widelands&lt;/a&gt;. It kills an enormous amount of time, but not in the hungry way Diablo keeps you salivating for the better item, the next level, the next spell, nor the way Civilization famously makes you want to play "just one more turn." No, Widelands gives you a much looser grasp on the future. It seems rather to expand the present into a plenitude of pleasant dawdling. It's real-time, but very very slow. I left the game running while I went to get a cup of tea or put something in the oven. While I was away from the game, my little pastoral empire kept toiling away for me. There was something extremely comforting about the sense that &lt;em&gt;things were happening&lt;/em&gt; whether I was there or not. The music, sound effects, and quaint graphics helped. Meandering folk music drifted through the air. Birds chirped. Axes bit into trees with distant thuds, and hammers struck metal with a satisfying yet unalarming pong. Nothing was threatening or exciting, and everything was productive. I was more or less happy with my idyllic domain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what was the point? Soon, unfortunately, it became clear that there was an object to the game: To build your economy more efficiently than the other player (an AI, in my case), and, eventually, to destroy them. Once I realized this, I became invested in building my economy well, rather than whimsically. I learned what not to do, and I learned how to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;. I wanted to win. I narrowed my plans to ever more efficient chains of actions. Eventually, it seemed to me that to play well was not playful at all, but to follow a set itinerary. I may as well, I thought, be a code interpreter executing a script.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wrote an essay on Widelands' constraints, and posted it to the their online forums. The response was "you sure have a depressing view of Widelands." I explained that I loved Widelands, but found it philosophically troubling. I couldn't understand what made it fun. I was told that "it's in the details" of each game. A cop-out. One may as well say "it's the little things in life."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eventually, when the season for tea and pie ended, I stopped playing Widelands. These days, my addictions are Diablo II and Torchlight. Entirely different pleasures, but I have reached a similar quandary with hack-and-slash RPGs. Soon I will probably stop playing them, as they increasingly seem pointless. But then, I lied earlier: When has pointlessness ever been what stopped me?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My quandary is that eternal one: You fight monsters to get items and experience points that allow you to fight bigger, scarier monsters, to get more items and experience points. Etc. It's not just circular; it's a paradox. You want the awesomest sword ever (or whatever) to really &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt; those monsters once and for all, but if this were to ever occur (if the monsters stopped modulating to your ability to kill them), you would become very quickly bored. On the other hand, because becoming more powerful merely gives you access to more powerful monsters, it makes no difference at all if you fight or not. The state of your relationship with the game world, with minor fluctuations, never really changes. What you want is for that little difference between your current state and your more powerful future to matter. You fight for the possession of something that is structurally impossible to get--in other words, a phallus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone commented in a Diablo II review that "the item system is truly something to behold." I have to assume what was meant by that is that the item system is of such staggeringly cruel complexity that it turns players pathological. The most sadistic innovation (back in 2000) are called "sockets". Some items of equipment have anywhere from one to three sockets. Gems, jewels, and runes may be placed in the sockets, which improve the item with various magical effects. My brother and I (we've been going through the game cooperatively) were at first only mildly excited by this. Socketed items were plentiful; things to put in the sockets, scarce and not amazing. Nonetheless, occasionally we threw some chipped gems (the worst kind) onto some wands and swords. Eventually we discovered better things to put into sockets, but our standards for what constituted a good item had risen. Moreover, there appeared to be fewer socketed items falling wily-nilly from monster's corpses. Then we were given what I can only call a transmogrifier. A box into which you put items, and it turns them into other, usually better items. For instance, three chipped gems may be turned into one flawed, three of those into a complete gem, and so on. Oh dear. This, as you might imagine, gave rise to a whole scheme of obsessive hoarding. We never wanted to put any of our gems into sockets because if we waited, we might get more gems and therefore make better gems. To just use them immediately was a waste. You can't remove things from sockets. Did I mention that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While we amassed huge collections of things to put in sockets, we noted that the shopkeepers no longer sold socketed items. We were now some ridiculous level and could equip the newest, shiniest swords and staves, but we could find no socketed versions of these now de-rigeur items. They had to be out there, somewhere, so we kept scouring the dungeons. Which yielded largely gems, runes, and jewels. Meanwhile, at any moment the &lt;em&gt;even shinier&lt;/em&gt; equipment was bound to become available soon. So even if we were graced with a socketed version of the current weaponry, it would be a waste to actually put our precious socket-plugs into weapons that would quickly become obsolete.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No one has expressed the process of collecting all this crap better than Yahtzee Croshaw in his recent &lt;a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/5777-Diablo-3"&gt;rant on Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I confess I still don't get the appeal of dungeon crawlers. Seems like I could recreate the essential experience by opening Microsoft Excel, scrolling down ten thousand pages with the down cursor key, and then typing "The Most Splendid Trousers of Them All!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Except that you would only &lt;em&gt;imagine&lt;/em&gt; typing that; the most splendid trousers are always to be found at some point in the future, never had. Yahtzee can characterize the repetitive banality of dungeon crawlers, yet he too can't stop playing them. They "put me into a fucking hypnotic trance and leveling starts to carry this mindlessly addictive quality."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why? I only have lame excuses. The novelty ("ooh what does that spell do?"). The vanity of watching your powers visualized on screen ("OMG look at everything explode!"). The reliability: unlike in life, there are no unexpected lulls in activity. There's always a pointless struggle waiting for you in the game. That's the best I've got--that the byzantine profusion of items and skills in Diablo II is not remarkable for the way it endlessly produces ambitions and endlessly defers fulfillment, but for the consistency with which it does so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no dawdling. My place in its world, however dreary, is quite clear: there are always monsters to slay, and items to sort to slay more monsters. In other words, there is very little freedom, which is nice. There is no possibility of getting lost, of drifting, of having to choose anything except where my points go after a level-up. I'm held tight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My brother and I also talk about how unplayably bad Diablo II is, and then continue to play it, rapidly clicking into the wee hours. One of our beefs is that this sort of game should be at least partially driven by story. That is, you ought to play it to unfold the story, which would be engaging enough that you want to know what happens next. It needn't be great literature; it just needs to incite the tiniest glimmer of curiosity. Diablo II fails to do even that. The story--dispensed in the grim, stilted monologues of quest-hawking characters--is both boring and completely unnecessary to play the game. I suppose I'm glad it isn't boring and &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;, because then I'd have to listen to all the droning on about evil and darkness, but I wish I gave enough of a shit to want to listen, and that what was said had some bearing on gameplay. As it is, we just click on the people with little exclamations over their heads (which I think is supposed to show you they have something to tell you, but really it just means "click on me to get another quest or a reward"), and skim the quest log afterwards for what we need to know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of this makes me nostalgic for Star Control II, whose dialogue was not only entertaining, but mattered. You had to pay attention to what was said because through interpretation (sometimes obvious, sometimes arcane) you figured out how to advance the game. Paying attention, however, was not a mind-numbing exercise, because the backstories were fairly interesting, and the writing was often hilarious. In Diablo II, by contrast, absolutely nothing is funny, and reading the backstories is a slog through a mixture of high fantasy cliches and pseudoreligious claptrap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So it was with a kind of hope other than the yearning for a new sword that I downloaded Torchlight. I'm one of those &lt;a href="http://projectnes.blogspot.com/2011/04/boys-drool-gauntlet-gauntlet-ii.html"&gt;boys who plays female characters in video games&lt;/a&gt;, so of course I played the Rogue--excuse me, the "Vanquisher". Combined with the fact that this genre of game seems to be an elaboration of masculinity, this put me in an odd position.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her costume, which includes a corset and not much else, seems clearly organized by the male gaze, and predictably, unlike the two male characters, she has a smile. I found myself trying to put some clothes on her. About mid-game I found a unique armor that when equipped dressed her in leather leggings and a full-sleeved leather coat. I thought she looked handsome in it. The game designers seemed to prefer rather that she show as much skin as possible, because in all my searching I never found another suit of armor that was much more than a bra and a short skirt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My annoyance with her revealing clothing is perhaps my internalization of a partriarchal need to control the veiling and unveiling of the female body, or in other words I wanted to protect her from other male gazes. On the other hand, this character was much more the object of my vanity than my ogling. These kinds of games are as much about getting the better sword as they are about preening once you have it. Torchlight has even built the pause button around this desire to admire yourself. When you hit it, the camera spins around your character, decked-out in all her latest gear. When I found the Leather Armor of the Gunslinger, I hit pause and thought &lt;em&gt;now I'm ready to slay some monsters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking at things, sorting things, using things--that's what playing Diablo and Torchlight is all about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your relationship to things is the central theme of Torchlight's story. Unlike Diablo, in which evil springs without cause from below, Torchlight's story is about obsessive exploitation of the earth (I mean literally underground) to find eternal life. It's about mining deeper and deeper for immortality, and becoming corrupted in the process. It is, in other words, about you, the player.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But of course your role as the player is to exorcise the specter of your real relationship to the game. Early on, one of the NPCs asks you "Are you, too, becoming obsessed with ember?" You set out to follow your obsession (ember works exactly like gems do in Diablo II, so you hoard it) and yet prove her wrong. Being a hero, you can enter into that which corrupts everyone, and undo it. Which is exactly what I want to do--the corrupter being the game. I want to purge the desire to play it from me, and to do so I must play it. To play I must believe that I can stop playing. But as soon as I want to stop, I have to play. What I hope awaits me at the end of the game, if there is one, is to be released from the game.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6555155141664350925/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/10/a-poor-player.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6555155141664350925'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6555155141664350925'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/10/a-poor-player.html' title='A Poor Player'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-2017770317095795171</id><published>2012-10-20T23:21:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:49:49.767-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Frozen Peaches</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;What does one do with frozen peaches? The underlying question, of course, is what does one do with peaches? There are so many of them, and they go so quickly. Can't have them rotting on the ground and yet if brought home they melt into the counter within a few days. Their already fuzzy skins bloom with white and black. They leave behind a goo, the underside of their ripeness. To capture them ripe without catching the toughness and putrefaction that define the borders of ripe is the passion of autumn, for some.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This passion can take two forms: anxiety and hoarding. These may sound like the same thing. But while the anxious is obsessed with wasted peaches (those on the ground are failures, or if not too rotten yet, rescues) the hoarder has a more generous outlok. The hoarder sees the peach season as an opportunity. Noteably,  the anxious has trees in the yard and is tasked  with caring for them (i.e. using them), whereas the hoarder rents others'.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The anxious picks as many as possible ripe off the tree and uses them immediately. Uses and not eats beause eating is only one use. Other uses include baking in a crisp and pairing with ice cream. Not so much pleasures as ways to cut losses. One does not so much taste the presence of peaches as the absence of the loss of peaches. One feels less a failure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hoarder, having access to far more trees, picks and picks. It's not much work, picking peaches, and so boxes and boxes fill up quickly. Here we return to the second question: what to do with all those peaches? One can't eat them quickly enough, even in a crisp. No matter. The hoarder believes ripeness can be preservered. Peaches can be frozen. Fleeting pleasure can be had throughout the year. As the anxious tastes the mitigation of failure, the hoarder tastes shrewdness in frozen peaches. Having given perishability the slip, one tastes oneself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now we come to the first question: What does not do with frozen peaches? Much as one would like to believe they are peaches, they're something else when they thaw. As they thaw, they release their liquid. They divide, much like curdling milk, into liquid and solid. A bowl of thawed peaches is a bowl of sweet, orange soup. One can ignore the soup, cover it with oats, butter, and sugar, and bake it, but the oats turn soggy. The peach-solids boil into near disintegration in the oven. But it is crisp, in it are still technically peaches, and one may still revel in the simulacric bounty of refrigeration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One may also acknowledge the soup, and treat its two components different. One then pours off the liquid into a pot, covers the solids with oats, butter, and sugar, and bakes them. One boils the liquid with more sugar and spices, down to a thick brown sauce, and pours this over the crisp. This necromantic trickery makes a less soggy crisp, but still, soggy, and the peaches, if indeed they are peaches, sad, deflated, and oddly flavorless without their sauce. Some things cannot be fixed or solved. To solve them is to change what the solution was meant to preserve. It would be smug, however, to suggest that the lack of a solution is a solution. It's not as if the gesture of stepping aside causes the peach to leap forth with its true flavor. On the unyielding terms one lays out, one has never tasted a peach.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/2017770317095795171/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/10/frozen-peaches.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2017770317095795171'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2017770317095795171'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/10/frozen-peaches.html' title='Frozen Peaches'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-638280296185203244</id><published>2012-10-13T19:22:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T19:20:08.821-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>Argo</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;When the screen faded to black and Ben Affleck's name appeared, everyone clapped. Renata Adler notes in 1968 that clapping for a movie is a peculiar gesture, "quite different from what it means in live theater." Who are you applauding? Nobody is there to hear you clap except the rest of the audience, and you. This was quiet, as applause goes. This is Ashland; audiences are gentle folk with multicultural pretensions. We listen to NPR. For us, Mr. Affleck had moved in just the right ways in his turn on the stage; he affirmed our concerns, and successfully navigated our national shame to give us a patriotic happy ending that we could approve of. For that moment, the audience basked in the communal warmth of their shared appreciation. I'm in basically the same boat as far as qualms, but I'm one of those prideful people who can't bear to participate in a crowd. I felt at once superior and pathetic for getting up to leave--passing relaxed, vaguely postcoital smiles that I envied and reviled--as everyone else stayed for the rest of the credits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I gather that Affleck feels a similar mixture of pride and shame about his country's involvement in Iran. His movie opens as a grave documentary, with footage of the Iranian Revolution. A voiceover narrates Iran's history up to 1979. The Shahs. The democratic election of a president. The period in which (the narrator tells us proudly) Iran's oil was their own. The U.S. installation of a new Shah (here the narrator's voice turns bitter). The 1979 uprising against this Shah. It's not that I disagree on any particular point (I'm not informed enough), but I have to wonder why this bit of exposition is here. This is the story of getting American "hostages" (actually they're just hiding out in the Canadian ambassador's house in Tehran) out of Iran. It's an American story. This five-minute introduction to a place that throughout the rest of the movie must at all costs be fled is the lefty equivalent of a hail-mary. Without it, the audience would not have clapped, but only enjoyed, somewhat guiltily. Affleck is atoning for his privileged Americanness in a popular style: by having fits of reaching for the experience of who he isn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience that the movie can't show becomes quite clear when the actual movie begins with a crowd of Iranian protesters storming the U.S. embasy. Affleck's direction in this scene exercises admirable control, but this I think is because he's straining to resolve it in a politically correct way. It flicks back and forth between the panicked Americans in the embasy, and the crowd. The crowd is a crowd: impossible to sympathize with, because this kind of sympathy has the individual as its basic unit. What can an American director who wants not to offend anyone do, when given Americans under a siege of foreign righteousness? I suppose you can push the onus of morality onto individual irrationality, which is to say you can do away with moral thought entirely. To protect the embassy there are some policemen of some sort or other, in full riot gear, with tear gas launders. Their commander tells them over the radio to "only use the tear gs a last resort--I repeat, as a last resort &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt;." Cut immediately to tear gas canisters being launched into the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the point of a movie that on the one hand refuses to be overtly political, and on the other refuses to be a drama--something it seems to view as being of inadequate importance? One might equally ask what is the point of Affleck's taut montages, in which he smashes all the locuses of tension together? A man behind me during one of these breathtaking multiscenes said "interesting juxtaposition." It was. All at once, prisoners are sent to a firing squad and almost but not quite executed, a press event Hollywood party in which the actors read the terrible Argo script aloud proceeds gaily and vapidly along, and some other thing that I can't quite remember. I'm sure it was important. But that's the trouble. Shouldn't I remember, if this meticulously edited sequence--in which audio from all three scenes piles up into a cacophony-- really made an impact? I remember a similar, simpler technique in &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;: while on the raging battlefield millions die at a king's strategically poor orders, this king eats cherry tomatoes alone. He makes quite a mess, spurting tomato juice with every bite. Cutting back and forth between these two things, the king's minstrel sings a plaintive song. It was memorable because its moralistic meaning was too unmistakeable. Affleck's crucibles of disparity are just the opposite. The justaposition is interesting, and not at all obvious in its intent, but all I can do is scratch my head, and feel inexplicably somewhat moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The script, likewise, aims away from the head toward the heart, but politely fires a very small calibur. Hearts pump with and are revealed by epistles, and this movie's heart is written on a postcard to Affleck's character's son as he goes to the airport. "Sorry I missed ya, buddy-man," he writes. He tried to call him for his birthday, but nobody picked up. His son's absent presence is the tiny looseness from which narrative flows. As the direction is restrainted, so is the world these characters inhabit. When Affleck's character is on the phone with his son (someone who is nerver on screen), there's a needful lapse. His son is telling him about school, but his voice mutes out as Affleck spaces out, staring at the television, on which &lt;em&gt;Planet of the Apes&lt;/em&gt; is playing (his son is watching the same). He's listening, but all we get is emotional content. The idea to make a fake movie as a cover to rescue the Americans stranded in Iran comes to him during a swell of love for his son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular brand of masculine sentimentality for the family holds throughout. Affleck's character and the fake filmmaker he hires (Alan Arkin) bond over the absence of their families, from whom they are both estranged ultimately, they think, because they're in "the bullshit business." In this movie, the bullshit business is lifesaving potential; the ability to create, believe, and convince others of narratives is survival out there in the public sphere. What they're saying is that their heroism tragically seperates them from domestic life. Which is nice for them because it's sad for them. How else to maintain such a sentimental attachment but absence? And how else to drive the creation of narrative but by this attachment? Besides, as Arkin's character says, "kids need the mother." One thing about a period piece based on a true story is that characters can say things like this without comment, cinematic or verbal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't mean to suggest that the script or Affleck's direction are dumb. Rather, the movie's intelligence all goes into saying as little as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affleck is capable of trying to engage with the world. &lt;em&gt;The Town&lt;/em&gt; wrapped its head around the phenomenon of how one becomes trapped in a place, a family, and a destiny, try as one might to escape it and its criminality. It's about a very particular place; I got the impression there was research involved in writing the script. &lt;em&gt;Argo&lt;/em&gt;'s script is too scary to direct because too potentially contentious. Affleck tries to tiptoe around Iran, however much time the camera spends there, because of how relevant the subject matter is right now, when two presidential candidates are debating about what to do or not to do about the country. He becomes much like the protagonist he plays--an escape artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has a boyish face, with sharp rather than rough features--as angular as a young Bruce Willis, but open and gentle about the eyes somehow, especially in profile. Both can summon an immense, suffocating smugness, but Affleck has chosen to avoid doing so in this movie. Instead he is a man so conflicted he's taciturn, and rigorously maintains a neutral expression, just barely smiling when pleased. When their flight out of Tehran reaches altitude and the stewardesses begin serbing drinks, the six he's rescued cheer and embrace. He sits alone at a window seat and allows himself a tiny, sheepish, one-sided smile.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/638280296185203244/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/10/argo_8303.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/638280296185203244'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/638280296185203244'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/10/argo_8303.html' title='Argo'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4398272207233741824</id><published>2012-10-11T08:46:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T19:45:39.986-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Figs &amp; Toilets</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Is eating fruit a perversion? If you're bored, it's a cheering thought. While picking figs the other day, I heard it articulated like this: "these trees must be so unhapppy--they spent all this energy putting on fruit, just to have us flush the seeds down our indoor plumbing." The assumption is that trees produce fruit for a purpose: to reproduce. This seems obvious, but it is also untrue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Evolutionary thought, oddly, seems to undergird this assumption of fruit's purposiveness, in the same way that the tired image of basket weavers and hunters is mobilized to naturalize the most thoughtless gender prescriptions. I do have to assume that fruit evolved because trees that grew fruit begat more reproducing offspring than trees that did not. However, the accidents of evolution--canny as they might be--do not assign or come from any purpose whatsoever. (A tautology--but honestly, do you want to read an argument that evolution is accidental? Suffice to say evolution is a misleading term, because it's not a system.) Fruit just happened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides, if trees &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; people, then who are we to say they insist on the reproductive use of their fruit? And even if they insist that their detachable flesh only be chewed for the furthering of the race, who is to say they don't enjoy wantonness for exactly the same reason?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know, I'm reaching. But when I heard it said matter-of-factly that figs are "like balls" the train of thought was inevitable, wasn't it? No, actually--that's my point. I think you'll agree that just because I heard that statement and now I'm writing this post, this post was not its purpose. Yet I am enjoying this particular use. Because it is excessive, or just because?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the same outing, as we exerted ourselves jumping to and climbing on branches, I posited the dreariest view of food imaginable by saying that we certainly were not doing this for the calories. Of course not. If you have the chance not to, why do something out of necessity?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So no, eating fruit is not a perversion, flush toilet or no, because there isn't one thing fruit are made for in the first place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's not as if anyone is all in a tizzy over orchards (all those "virgin" trees). Then again, isn't this exactly what pastoral beauty is all about--the sublime channeled into production?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fruit does fall, and I must admit I looked away from the figs smashed into the ground, and I hesitated yet was excited by the squishy give of the overripe. The fallen (that word cannot be an accident) figs stuck unpleasantly to our shoes. Importantly, figs will not sprout in this climate. Whether I think so or not, it appears I'm uncomfortable with flesh not trained to produce or reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/10/figs-toilets.html' title='Figs &amp;amp; Toilets'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/4398272207233741824/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/10/figs-toilets.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4398272207233741824'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4398272207233741824'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/10/figs-toilets.html' title='Figs &amp;amp; Toilets'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-1922333983958383311</id><published>2012-10-05T18:13:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T19:45:39.973-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>some incredibly sloppy theorizing</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;It is said that western civilization sprang from wheat. These days, although it remains staff of life to many, it’s often called junk food, or if you’re a paleo dieter, just plain evil. And what is considered junk by the pious is also a comfort, or even more: an indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is guaranteed by the degree to which its emptiness is insisted upon. How else could a dry Starbucks scone constitute pleasure than by the reflexive tut-tut that it’s “just empty carbs”? This sense of their substancelessness makes baked goods palatable in unique ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though if 1890s London is as Sarah Waters imagines it, then perhaps bread needn’t be saturated with health-food discourse to go down like nearly nothing. In &lt;em&gt;Tipping the Velvet&lt;/em&gt;, bread products are all that its protagonist, Nancy, can handle after a catastrophic breakup. She lays in a dark bedsit for weeks eating nothing but “bagels, brioches, and flat Greek loaves, and buns from the Chinese bakeries” and cups of tea, “which I brewed ferociously strong, in a pot on the hearth, and sweetened with condensed milk.” God, if that ever sounds familiar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I have spent weeks alone eating little but toast and tea. When anything substantial is nauseating, toast will do.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote that &lt;a href="http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/01/appetite-of-sarah-lund.html"&gt;Sarah Lund’s diet&lt;/a&gt; of mostly bread, butter, and coffee was deeply appealing to me, for similar reasons. Baked goods can be passed off as almost not food at all. Lund is perennially, functionally depressed, and Nancy is suddenly becoming acquainted with depression. The will to live and the will to eat are connected in this way. When I say “will to live,” I do not mean it literally, though the sense does not disinclude that. Nancy’s post-breakup melancholy is the instructive example here: she can’t move on from her former lover, despite (or because of) the fact that she is clearly and acutely gone. Letting anything else in–even a bit of food–is abhorrent because it would mean letting go of this nothingness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which sounds self-defeating, and it is. But I do not want to fall into the judgemental prescriptiveness of phrases like “let go” and “move on.” In the pop-psychologic vernacular, these imperatives lie (pun intended) firmly on the side of productivity. They prioritize orienting oneself to the future. But what’s in the future? More moving on. One moves on to float in an endless deferral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contemplation is possessive, i.e. depressive. Indeed, depression is to be blocked from acting by the sheer bandwidth of cognition. Writing is thus a bizarre balancing act of thinking and not thinking. Don’t think at all and you’ll have nothing to write; think too much and you’ll never be able to write it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One cannot eat a feast and at the same time possess it. But the world–and oneself in it–turns on consumption, and so it is generally thought advantageous to advocate eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this helpful prescription turns sour, there are ways to mitigate the bile–to keep distance from both life and death. To not have to take on the burden of having hope (the backlash from which Nancy suffers), one takes in whatever unwholesomeness is available. Bread, being neither food nor not-food, will do nicely. It is an imperfect antidote to the illness it makes possible–civilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What will happen to a civilization that demands productivity from its citizens and also demands that they keep themselves healthy by not eating “empty carbs,” not smoking, not drinking, and absolutely no other vice, save sex, which has been deemed healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, of course all these vices are the opiates on which civilization functions, and some more revolutionary souls would say it’s better to renounce them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not trying to say that society’s prescriptions ought to self-consciously indulge us. You can’t go back. But rather that there seem to be increasingly fewer blind spots. Which is a bit scary. Everything is a lifestyle choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What, are we all going to binge on naughty kale chips?&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/10/some-incredibly-sloppy-theorizing.html' title='some incredibly sloppy theorizing'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/1922333983958383311/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/10/some-incredibly-sloppy-theorizing.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1922333983958383311'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1922333983958383311'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/10/some-incredibly-sloppy-theorizing.html' title='some incredibly sloppy theorizing'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8359901181130499248</id><published>2012-10-03T22:15:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T15:39:03.450-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>I am endeavouring, ma'am, to construct a mnemonic memory circuit using stone knives and bearskins.</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Star Trek (the original) is nearly unwatchable. Thus it is populated with babes in costumes whose designer seems to grin lasciviously from behind the camera. When their bodies aren't giving relief from the creak of plastic gears--or if you prefer, the shouting of men--a particular kind of head shot is. The female guest star's face is in soft focus, and lit from a slightly oblique angle, so that her hair shines ethereally. Her face glows, and her glowing smile appears indeed from another planet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the rest of our heroes boldly go where no man has gone before--namely, portals--Uhura says "Captain, I'm afraid."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To a trekkie, it's already apparent that I'm really speaking of one episode, "The City on the Edge of Forever". (But that way of filming female faces holds throughout the series, I swear.) I began watching the episode because I know someone who is obsessed with the writer, Harlan Ellison. I was wikipediaing him, and discovered he wrote an episode of Star Trek. What really interested me, though, was that he hated the adaptation of his script so much that he went to court. I had to see what all the fuss was about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Controversy could only bouy me so much against the sinking dullness of the show, however. I couldn't make it through the episode. It was one of those "travelling back in time screws up the present" plots. When it is revealed that what changes the future for the worse is the U.S. not going to war with Germany during World War Two, my cursor fled to the pause button. I longed for a non-butterfly-effect time travel concept, as in Kage Baker. At least when written history cannot be changed, jingoistic self-justification (whenever we feel national shame, it seems, we can always fall back on "but we saved the world!") isn't possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But anyway, I wasn't intending masturbate about taste. I haven't read Ellison's script, but I have a conjecture. When he wrote an episode for Star Trek, what was he expecting when it got aired? Star Trek is still Star Trek. Every writer has a rebellious streak of some sort--otherwise why write--but I think Ellison's was particularly strong. When he wrote an episode of Star Trek, he wanted it to exceed the bounds of what a Star Trek episode could be. He wanted to make something daring, perhaps with a bit of commentary on the show itself. He wanted to inject a bit of not-Star Trek into Star Trek, to give it a little life. So when he saw what ultimately made it to the screen, he was pissed. This wasn't the edgyness he had imagined.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I make fun, but it's perfectly understandable. (Although it does take a special kind of stubbornness to take Paramount to court four decades later for rewriting his script.) Even writing a piece for &lt;a href="http://brightwalldarkroom.com/"&gt;Bright Wall in a Dark Room&lt;/a&gt;, at least half my motivation was something along the lines of &lt;em&gt;I'll show them!&lt;/em&gt; I felt that I was in some way shaking up the genre of BWDR. Such an attitude may be necessary, along with the idealizations that come with it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There's something phallic about this conception of creativity in which one creates within confines but yearns to exceed those confines, and in so doing reveal one's idealized self in the difference. One pretends to want freedom from the confines, but without them one would not be able to create, nor would one want to. Ellison raged against the apparatus of his articulation. He saw too much of the apparatus, and not enough of himself. Despite the angelic face of its female guest star, the episode wasn't pornographic enough.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://sweatingdark.blogspot.com/2012/10/i-am-endeavouring-maam-to-construct.html' title='I am endeavouring, ma&amp;#39;am, to construct a mnemonic memory circuit using stone knives and bearskins.'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/8359901181130499248/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/10/i-am-endeavouring-ma-to-construct_2432.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8359901181130499248'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8359901181130499248'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/10/i-am-endeavouring-ma-to-construct_2432.html' title='I am endeavouring, ma&amp;#39;am, to construct a mnemonic memory circuit using stone knives and bearskins.'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-7538703576218926844</id><published>2012-10-01T17:59:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T15:39:03.445-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>Elena</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There is a horse. There is also a man, and his grandson in law. The first two die; the last lies on the ground so long after being beaten that it seems he dies, but he gets up. What else needs to be known? When the horse passes into view out the train window, a little boy cries "look!" Hitting it, presumably, was why the train came to a stop a few moments before, and why policemen hurried through the car. The eponymous Elena seemed to fidget when the uniforms clomped through, but then, she doesn't actually move much. I just know that she killed the aforementioned man, her husband, Vladimir, and therefore I imagine her pang of fear and guilt at the sight of the law. Anyway, in the extreme long view &lt;em&gt;Elena&lt;/em&gt;--but not Elena--takes Vladimir may as well be the dead horse. Indeed, why does he die? For the sake of her grandson, who could die any day in a gang fight. Vladimir, who unapologetically cares for nothing but money, would have thought his own death a poor investment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About perspective. The film begins and ends with a shot of winter tree limbs in front of Vladimir's house. The focus begins at the foremost branch, and very slowly shifts to the house's windows. Vladimir and Elena live in one of those brutally convenient modernist things that was once so outside the box, it became one. He sleeps in the worst part of it, she on a fold-out couch in the coziest room, truer to her class origins. The two of them met when she was nurse to him in the hospital, and it seems that as his wife she has carried on in this same capacity. Watching Elena go about her domestic duties is like a defanged version of &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073198/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jeanne Dielman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. She has less routine, and less time for her routine to explode, but explode it does.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Vladimir tells her that he plans to write a will, that his daughter, Katya, will get almost everything, and that he has no intention of providing for her grandson, she takes his dishes (on a designer wooden tray) back to the kitchen and sets them down roughly, with a clang. The next day she furtively reads his draft; cut to her feeding carrots into a juicer, which sounds remarkably like paper shredding. It is alongside this frothy carrot juice that she serves him an excess of pills, popping extras into the cup with a kind of nervous whimsy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elena speaks, but she is understood through her actions, though the body language of her long, patient time on the screen. I fell in love with the head of this film, who does nothing but speak, and who happens to be Vladimir's pretty daughter. It seems not too shaky of a conjecture that Andrey Zvyagintsev, writer and director, fancied her, too. He imbued her with the whole of the truth-telling--and all the word play, to boot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the linguistic articulation of the film's cinematic distance, she, too, takes the long view. Her father accuses her of saying everything is pointless. She does. There is a bit of cheek, though, to her dire pronouncements. She's deadly serious, but so sometimes are the best comedians. Everything may be pointless, but people like Zvyagintsev would like to believe that there is a point in communicating why. I'm in the same boat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the more memorable things she says is that one has children to suck the life from them. Of course, the opposite occurs--quite literally, if indirectly. Not that Elena's grandson wants the money that she goes to such ends to get for him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for Vladimir, he smiles and says that he's cheered up by his daughter's caustic words. So, I find, am I. These two scenes, in which with her tongue she first dispatches Elena and then Vladimir in his hospital bed following a heart attack, are the only clarity, and the only real mirth. Although, personally, I giggled at the bits of television that were chosen for the domestic scenes. After Elena kills Vladimir, she's watching people evaluate a new "sausage product." "I like No. 6. It's quite edible." "No 3 tastes very sausagey." Katya's verbal flaying, however, did more than elicit quiet giggles. I was warmed through.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I barely see you, Katya," says Vladimir.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"That's because I'm standing against the light." (She's in front of the window.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I didn't mean it in that sense."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Dad, you know that nothing like sense even exists."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Looking at you, sometimes I think, that might even be true."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"So, it's OK that you barely see me."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their dialogue goes on like this, full of puns and metaphor. Yes, this was the filmmaker's transparent philosophizing, yet its agile twists along words' axes thrilled me. I could've kissed her. Her father did. The consonance of these was, I admit, a little discomforting. Yet still my fervor is enough that I want to reprint just a bit more of the script here:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You've always loved those word games."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Games help children come to terms with the cruel laws of reality."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Children?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Nope. Not going to happen. I'm not pregnant, if that's what you were asking."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Too bad. It'd sort you out."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I am sorted. Alcohol and drugs only on the weekends. It's clean living now. Of all the pleasures I'm still getting sex and food under control, but I'm working on myself, trust me."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Katya does nothing but express her interiority, however sarcastically; Elena becomes a sublime object, despite how much time there is to watch and get to know her. In part this is because Katya--who has the last word on everything--distrusts her performances. "Listen, Elena Anatolievna. You're playing the role of the worried wife. You do that very well. Congratulations." I therefore contracted the same paranoid reading of Elena's every facial movement. This both made her fascinating to watch, and is rather unforunate. Vladimir by contrast is highly readable. For a little while the camera follows him about his day. He goes to the gym; he ogles girls. The only perhaps mystifying thing about him is his rejection of pleasure, which is a fairly mundane bit of father psychology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Defamiliarizing the feminine is rather familiar. But then, I already admitted the origin of this scrutiny. Isn't this just how the wealthy eye the poor: with the suspicion that the poor are out to take their money? In this case, it's true. By the end, Elena's family have taken over Vladimir's house. But while the hysterical search for the actor behind the act may have a sound cause, there's no sense in it. Which makes me wonder about having watched &lt;em&gt;Elena&lt;/em&gt;, during which I looked endlessly for signs of Elena.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you prefer your movie-going sensible or senseless?&lt;/p&gt; </content><link rel='related' href='http://sweatingdark.blogspot.com/2012/10/elena.html' title='Elena'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/7538703576218926844/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/10/elena_7707.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7538703576218926844'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7538703576218926844'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/10/elena_7707.html' title='Elena'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8487004967256168424</id><published>2012-09-24T02:06:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T15:39:03.451-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>Date Night</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 12px; margin-top: 12px;"&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;It's the seed of the whole plot, but I'm sorry, this couple is not discontent. Which is to say I would have been quite content for them to continue lazily, guiltily going to the same dreary place for dinner every "date night", endlessly deferring sex for some other night, and becoming (god forbid) "excellent housemates". But for some reason or other--I'm guessing because there was a movie to be made--this was a nightmare scenario. You wouldn't know it, though, watching the two of them. They seem quite pleased with themselves engaged in what appears to be the foundational pleasure of their relationship: making up stories about the couples at the other tables. And I would be quite pleased to have such uproarious company. But no. There has to be a &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;problem&lt;/span&gt; to fix.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 12px; margin-top: 12px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;There being to my mind no problem to fix, you can imagine that the build-up to its resolution was to me a declension. Everything, depressingly, slides into place: Carrel's character rediscovers his masculinity, and Fey's remembers how to supplicate. The comedians manage not to get subsumed into the genre action flick they poke fun at, but slip instead into the sad conventions of a romantic comedy. Their complaints against each other are just cliche mercenaries hired for their pointless arguments. He leaves drawers and toilet seats open. She does every domestic task because she doesn't trust he can do anything right. I find myself, unsurprisingly, on her side. When it turns out he's compotent at planning their escape from the criminal mess they stumbled into, I'm incredulous. He has to explain everything to her, twice, because "you know I've never been good with complicated plots." After his second explanation, I'm still lost. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 12px; margin-top: 12px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;It's noteworthy that the only way out of the ossification of marriage, in this film, is mortal danger. Their complaint is that their life together is too smooth, which is after all the advantage of having an income and a spouse, in theory. During the course of their crazy night, their motives get mixed up. They're trying to get out of danger, to "just go home", but they're trying to get in as many scrapes with death as possible to avoid the routine of their marriage. These two drives are crystalized in conflation when, after a half-frank, half-sappy discussion in which Fey's character says she doesn't dream of running off with another man, but of being alone, they pause at a window pane: "this will be our second time breaking and entering this evening, making us repeat offenders." "Better than excellent houesmates."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 12px; margin-top: 12px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Oddest of all about this movie is its paradox: to reconstitute the dull, it must be shaken up. There are a lot of politically correct gender gestures in the shaking up (he's a better pole dancer, she has the balls to break into an office), but ultimately it's a shake-down. They go through all this so that their normativity might feel like it has more "panache." Which is the word the husband uses, comically, to describe the heroic drive to the city he's gonna--by god--take his wife on. They end up stuck in traffic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://sweatingdark.blogspot.com/2012/09/date-night.html' title='Date Night'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/8487004967256168424/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/09/date-night_8474.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8487004967256168424'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8487004967256168424'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/09/date-night_8474.html' title='Date Night'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8893649929935594397</id><published>2012-09-20T01:18:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:07:45.333-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Pics'/><title type='text'>Preliminary Materials for a Theory of the Backpacker</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RADVuFJxmzw/UGC9MkI6xPI/AAAAAAAAEe4/qjGxcEnBAxA/s1600/IMG_0755.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="479" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RADVuFJxmzw/UGC9MkI6xPI/AAAAAAAAEe4/qjGxcEnBAxA/s640/IMG_0755.JPG" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Backpacking is the journey from trailhead to lake. Yes, the destination could be any body of fresh water, but I don't want to complicate things. Besides, as a backpacker do you go for a line or a point on a map?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The backpacker must labor. Backpacking must be at least in part gruelling. Monotonous switchbacks are not absolutely necessary, but they are a fundamental metaphor for the experience of the trail. The trail is hot and dusty; the lake is wet and cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A vacation is a microcosm, or so you wish. The backpacker imagines that at the end of labor is sweetness. The trail is the arena of this imagination. It traverses uncertain terrain and arrives at the promised kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vistas, like certain other fussed-over unveilings, must be conserved. To have a vista of the lake the whole way is obscene. Just as there must be labor, there must be blindness. You must travel under the sparse cover of millions of unremarkable trees. Continuing down the dreary viewless path proves your faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to worry. The backpacker gets a reward. You will round a bend to a revelation. That's what a vista is, no matter how many postcards you've seen. The revelation consists of three things: a lake, conifer trees, and vertical relief. You may be able to dissect these elements, but consciousness plays no part here. You will gasp. Make no mistake: this reveals no more nature than pupil dialation tests. Yet you will be equally helpless. The backpacker looks about in wonder: such a clear jewel of a lake, such bright stone, such green trees! Such a dramatic landscape!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If all the elements are in place, the felicity of the revelation is certain. The backpacker ogles rocks. The landscape beams right through you, undigestable. The backpacker often carries freeze-dried food, but doesn't have to carry Sublime Concentrate. The backpacker already inhales it through the eyes. It may be swarming with people, but we've yet to find a stronger dose than Yosemite Valley. Just look at it, and tell me it exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At small gaps in the trees where towers of exposed rock are visible, the backpacker stops and gapes, and exclaims. A seemly trail may tease discreetly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideally, the backpacker is alone on the lake. The backpacker may smile at other backpackers, but backpackers want to avoid each other. More specifically, backpackers want to avoid seeing each other. The backpacker must imagine solitude at the lake. The backpacker is unique to the backpacker, and wants to be unique to the lake. Visible backpackers ruin it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, the backpacker's sense of obscenity transfers from the other backpackers to the lake. In this case, the lake is referred to as a popular spot. The backpacker seeks out less popular spots.</content><link rel='related' href='http://photocortex.blogspot.com/2012/09/preliminary-materials-for-theory-of.html' title='Preliminary Materials for a Theory of the Backpacker'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/8893649929935594397/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/09/preliminary-materials-for-theory-of.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8893649929935594397'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8893649929935594397'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/09/preliminary-materials-for-theory-of.html' title='Preliminary Materials for a Theory of the Backpacker'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RADVuFJxmzw/UGC9MkI6xPI/AAAAAAAAEe4/qjGxcEnBAxA/s72-c/IMG_0755.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4541470224219485274</id><published>2012-09-19T10:26:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.372-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Pini Fruit</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;My family always jokes--and joked--that we travel to eat. It's a tendency that has, according to us, been passed down to the younger generation (my brother and I). The family trait appears to install itself as a constraint in the scope of memory recall. When asked about the trips that our parents took us out of school and country for--to Bali, Mexico, Cuba, Canada, Borneo, and Japan (one of which I, I admit, is a lie I added to fill out the list)--we recount the food. More convenient, sometimes, than recounting the rest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Likewise, the images from books that really stick with me--and hopefully you distrust me by now--are of food. This is especially true Ursula Le Guin's sci-fi, which are "safe trips"* to various worlds. They chronicle the intergalactic Ekumen's (a kind of postcolonial Federation) encounters with aliens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I remember the pini fruit from &lt;em&gt;Four Ways to Forgivesness&lt;/em&gt;, a "curious orange-brown" globe that falls into perfect little radial segments, like a mandarin or a mangosteen. Consumed almost entirely by the slave-owning class, its smooth, finely textured flesh seems almost artificial. The Envoy from the Ekumen is treated as an "owner" (rather than an "asset"), and thus is given these fruit. She eats them--popping out the segments delicately with a small knife--with a mixture of guilt and delight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;True to our familial mythology, my memory of the fruit glares out all others. I have mentioned it many times in conversation--a strange habit, ass even those who have read the book don't remember what I refer to--always with a reverent stare into nowhere, mouth watering for a fictional fruit. And that's what it's for--to be desired and consumed. Even for fruit it is oddly suited for civilized consumption--the segments bite-sized and so neat, eating them not at all messy. Even for an inanimate object, it lacks otherness. No spines, fuzz, juices, seeds, or pits. It doesn't even bruise easily. It's completely purposive, the asset qua asset--what the assets (slaves) can never be. Having no incidental qualities, no ontological leftovers, it is pointless to consume it (though inevitable). Being so well suited for consumption, it is nothing to consume. Nothing about it can be had because everything about it is to be had, a priori. As its whole purpose is to be eaten, to be had, to be taken pleasure from, and therefore, in its relentless felicity, utterly fails--passing through its owners, as it were, and leaving nothing but another dim desire for another--it is, more than anything, viral. A benign virus, it doesn't threaten its host with death, or even give rise to any unpleasant sensations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is what the owners dream of owning. But if they did, their world would fall into silence. No energies would need be expended upon elaborate systems of opression and suppression. There would be nothing to be better than, to own. The lifeblood of aspiration and delusion gone, the culture of the owners would wither. In this sense the fruit does leave behind one thing: It gives the owners an ideal to strive for, one which is actually their destruction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Generally, however, the food in Le Guin's fiction is more Eros than Thanatos. It posesses a presence that food, in my experience, never does. There is a bottle of fruit juice in &lt;em&gt;The Disposessed&lt;/em&gt; (on Annarres, the anarchist planet, of course). While the pini fruit is the epitomy of Capitalist object relations, Le Guin seems to elsewhere wish for the healing of that relation. The fruit juice is precious in a way that things can never be in a well-oiled, affluent consumer society: One gets a tiny ration of fruit juice, per the limited amount that can be produced on dry Anarres. About a liter a year. So this stuff that's so mundane (because plentiful) to us on the receiving end of industrial agriculture's boon is transformed by scarcity into something to be savored. They save it for a special occasion, and sip it in tiny cups. The liquid becomes luminous. While Le Guin calls this world "an ambiguous utopia" and is as interested in finding its faults as its idyllic qualities, here she seems to salivate. Life on Anarres may be hard, but it is very &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;. The scarcity is romantic. Anarres has not solved material ills, but seems to have solved the ills of the soul. This is the end of Capitalism as imagined in Capitalist terms: Things are precious and full of substance because rare. In this, the people of Anarres sound more like bohemians--who quest ever for authenticity, i.e. an escape from consumerism--than socialists.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/09/pini-fruit.html' title='Pini Fruit'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/4541470224219485274/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/09/pini-fruit.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4541470224219485274'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4541470224219485274'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/09/pini-fruit.html' title='Pini Fruit'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-6158131258998517116</id><published>2012-09-12T18:07:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:07:45.323-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Pics'/><title type='text'>The Final Solution</title><content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dweJucwCu_o/UFExj59Gn5I/AAAAAAAAEeo/8Qzw-3qegRo/s1600/0c9b6f954cd1_a3300734-c045-4586-8118-9b9192b2f046.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dweJucwCu_o/UFExj59Gn5I/AAAAAAAAEeo/8Qzw-3qegRo/s1600/0c9b6f954cd1_a3300734-c045-4586-8118-9b9192b2f046.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't matter that the political motives are not immediately discernable in the plaza redesign. In Ashland, politics and The Homeless Problem are inseperable. To say that the plaza redesign is at heart an attempt to reorganize the homeless population is not jumping to a conclusion or going out on a limb. Before knowing anything, it's a reasonable assumption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is true because the reactives whom this assumption is a reaction to carry the same assumption: everything is about the homeless. When the Oak Knoll fire happend, the man who allegedly started it could not simply be homeless, but a part of a larger problem. The psyche of this town is such that before he was even named, the problem was waiting for him to become evidence. For the same reason, the problems of downtown businesses are not the problems of downtown businesses. Businesses are persecuted by the homeless, so business owners say, who in turn are persecuted by the bleeding hearts who defend the homeless. It's rather cozy, really--a warm blanket of infinite scapegoats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind the words "plaza redesign" a whole unspoken rhetoric stands ready. The plaza is a problem because the homeless hang out there. Their presence scares off tourists, and therefore reduces the money they spend in the surrounding shops. The plaza must be made somehow unappealing to the homeless. It must be cleaned of the stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine what kind of plaza would dissuade homeless from loitering. (The rows of metal spikes that keep birds off come to mind, personally.) Find one of those St. Vincent de Paul donation boxes put up recently downtown, and read it. Imagine, if you can, the mechanism by which the presence of or donations to these boxes could reduce panhandling downtown. If you're feeling particularly brave, try to imagine what the mastermind behind these boxes imagines panhandling to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On both sides of this divisive and all-subsuming issue, it appears, we await a solution. The business owners wait for the law to push the problem away, and the bleeding hearts wait for reform to address "the root of the problem" (that elusive thing to which one can always eliptically refer). Whether it's a beautiful moment of guilt-dissolving healing, or a righteous sweeping away of "the bad element" we seek, something golden awaits us at the end of our labors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The root of the problem is the ground on which we stand. Or at the very least, on which we shop for organic produce. Not that this is the end of history, but were Capitalism to dissolve, we wouldn't have to win the aesthetic purity of downtown Ashland to lubricate the flow of tourist dollars. However, those are only the particulars of the problem. Contrary to our utopian hopes, there's always someone to agonize over.&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://photocortex.blogspot.com/2012/09/the-final-solution.html' title='The Final Solution'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6158131258998517116/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/09/the-final-solution.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6158131258998517116'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6158131258998517116'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/09/the-final-solution.html' title='The Final Solution'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dweJucwCu_o/UFExj59Gn5I/AAAAAAAAEeo/8Qzw-3qegRo/s72-c/0c9b6f954cd1_a3300734-c045-4586-8118-9b9192b2f046.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-9138241838051777580</id><published>2012-09-08T22:59:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2012-12-03T19:11:56.361-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>Dangerous Liaisons</title><content type='html'>What does it take for me to enjoy a film about nothing but sex?* First, evacuate all sentiment. Turn it into a sociopathic game. Then slowly let sentiment seep back in. Drag it through wet Paris streets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weather in &lt;em&gt;Dangerous Liaisons&lt;/em&gt; is more symbolic than atmospheric, following the declension of play. It begins in summer. Vicomte de Valmont (John Malkovich), the agent in this spy story of the heart, flounces ruthlessly about a sunny country estate in his pastel finery. He's trying to win a married woman's heart, for the fun of it, for his ego (the challenge), to impress the Marquise de Merteuil (Glenn Close), and because she stands for everything these two despise: "strict morals, religious fervor, and the happiness of her marriage." The game takes on a tinge of emotional investment around the time the rain begins. For the rest of the film, it rains off and on, and all the drama moves indoors. I would say the drama unfolds, but actually it folds inward, taking shape like origami. It ends in the snow, Vicomte impaled in a duel by a dumb-eyed Keanu Reeves (his diegetic name, Danceny). "Like mosts intellectuals, he's intensely stupid," the Marquise says of him, and later fucks him for a month or two. Winter, and the Keanus of the world win the day. The Marquise is publicly shamed for her libertinism, booed by a crowd in a theater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it were not for this booing, and the utter boringness of the characters of morals (rather than bored, which is what Vicomte and the Marquise are), this all would have seemed like a morality lesson. The two are punished for toying with the heart. The agent (Vicomte) finds True Love and is tortured because he destroys it. When he dies, the pupeetteer (the Marquise) loses who appears to be her one True Love, him. Despite the delightfully amoral beginning, it seems that the script is intent upon bashing its two cynical leads up against Love, which is apparently the salvation they cannot have. (This is logical; liaisons are, after all, dangerous. Cynicism does not equal invincibility.) Then again, they're conveniently saved from their salvation, by death. "Happiness," the Marquise points out, "cannot be had without regret." Vicomte has an infinitude of regret in his dying words: "He [Danceny] had good cause [to kill me]. I don't believe that's something anyone has ever been able to say about me."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thematic coherence of this script is tight enough that there's a running commentary on happiness, and one that does not rankle with false profundity. The word is threaded through everyone's dialogue and twists away antiphilosophically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It begins without being said as the Marquise and Vicomte set out to destroy others' happiness. She sends him on a mission to deflower a future bride, Cecile Volanges (Uma Thurman), because her husband-to-be avowedly values not the girl's money, but her "guaranteed virtue." Vicomte, however, is more interested in bedding the aforementioned Madame de Tourvel (Michelle Pfeiffer). When he performs a bizarre semblance of courting her, the talk of happpiness begins. He declares with soppy romance (she is a soppy romantic) that he values her happiness above his own. Just after the rainstorm hits, her mother dispenses antique wisdom: "Men enjoy the happiness they feel. We can only enjoy the happiness we give. They are not capable of devoting themselves exclusively to one person. So to hope to be made happy by love is a certain cause of grief." Heeding this stark female complaint, she leaves the estate and him by cover of night.&lt;br /&gt;Months later, she accepts his request to see her in Paris, and swiftly throws out the conclusion but not the analysis of her mother's vision of happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Him: "Why should you be so upset by the idea of making me happy?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her: "You're right, I can't live either unless I make you happy."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things tend to be thrown out at such times. He later confides to the Marquise that he was so caught up in it all that he pledged eternal love. "At that time, and for several hours afterwards, I actually meant it." But she does not have faith in his lack of faith. She thinks he just can't bear to think of himself as someone who actually falls in love. "Happiness and vanity," she says, her back to him, "are not compatible."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one time he almost manages to trick himself into being happy and approving of himself at the same time, by composing an entire letter of double entendre:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;My dear Madame de Tourvelle,&lt;br /&gt;I have just come [the woman whose naked back he's using as a desk giggles] to my desk in the middle of a stormy night during which I have been tossed from exaltation to exhaustion and back again. Yet despite these torments, I guarantee that at this moment I am far happier than you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;But then, that is wooing, not having.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This vision of happiness--just around the corner of self-consciousness--strikes me as at once true and suspect. Is it only mirrors that turn happiness against us?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of mirrors to impale oneself on in this film. Specifically, the Marquise gets caught on their sharp edges. While all of Vicomte's liaisons are played out directly in the camera's frame, hers are reflected in mirrors or alluded to. It's implied that her life is as wanton as his or more, but it's his exploits that the story follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To traverse her house (a task and a journey, I assure you) from receiving Vicomte's call to her lover secreted away in another room (ah, rooms: this film's antics could not function without the privacy of rooms), she must go through a doorway I cannot classify. It's studded with dozens of square mirrors, and curved inward toward the opening. The mirrors are curved, too, so that they distort what they reflect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set piece makes several appearances. The most memorable of which is the scene I referred to earlier, in which the Marquise realizes that Vicomte is actually in love with this woman he set out conquer. Her loves's love is directed elsewhere. He leaves the room; cut to the mirrors; distorted reflections of her contorted face (usually so calm) turn about the room. Now, I believe it's possible to read too far into something. I'm not &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; it, but I do think the question "but what does it mean?" is at its most futile when directed at strokes of modernism. I found myself asking just that when the camera turned on those mirrors. It would be easy to equate the reflective misdirection of eros and the cinematic preoccupation with mirrors--it's just a linguistic conceit of describing them both with a metaphor of direction. What such a shot is not is "psychological". I'll not discuss the "mental state" it expresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time she goes through that door-mirror, the camera follows her until she opens the next door behind which a liaison waits. It peers in the open door to a mirror on the wall, where she and her lover can be seen embracing. "Time has no logic when I'm not with you--an hour is like a century," he pleads. To which she cracks "I've told you before--we'll get along a great deal better if you make a concerted effort not to sound like the latest novel," and shuts the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's in this same mirror that she's perfectly framed, hovering above Vicomte and Danceny. Vicomte had burst in on she and Danceny in her bed--he sneaks through the door-mirror to get there--and this leads not to a fight, but to more scheming (as such interruptions do in this film). There she is, smirking at them in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One might see only artifice in this usage of mirrors, but she must perform the same acrobatics of perspective to access herself. She and Vicomte are masters of deception--she better than he, he admits. The film begins with the two being dressed in the morning, putting on their faces. It ends with her wiping makeup from her face in the mirror. It's an arduous process; she pushes and pulls the flesh of her face out of shape, and despite the force, can she get to the bottom of it? She fades to black with the top half of her face still pale with her mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has one uncharacteristically divulgent monologue. It's akin to when the murderer in a mystery spills forth how and why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Women are obliged to be far more skillful than men. You can ruin our reputation and our life with a few well-chosen words. So of course I had to invent not only myself but ways of escape that no one has thought of before. And I've suceeded because I've always known I was born to dominate your sex and avenge my own.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dangerous Liaisons&lt;/em&gt; both revels in these ways of escape, and meditates on how they might also imprison. (Her reflections in the multipaned doorway are doubly behind bars, between the window grilles behind her and the mirror grilles in front of her.) She hates marriage, has sex with "as many and in as many ways" as possible, and finds delight in screwing with others' lives. Yet her escape from this era's normativity is a mask that demands another mask. Keanus will be deluded into faith in the verity of the narratives they live. But being undeceived like her is to deceive others that she lives those same narratives, and to deceive herself that she does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* There is, I must say, a rape. It was all fun and games up until &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; point, not the other point on which I focus. I was, as you would expect, disturbed by this scene in which Vicomte enters Cecile's room while she sleeps, covers her mouth, tells her that were they were caught the blame would fall upon her, and forces himself upon her. However, the Marquise soon arrives at the house (in a yellow and black dress reminiscent of a hornet) to tell her not that she has been forever traumatized by an omnipotent penis, but rather that she may, if she is discreet, have all the sex she likes, or none at all. "You'll find the shame is like the pain--you only feel it once." Cecile cheers. In her case it was only the shame, apparently, that made the act distasteful.</content><link rel='related' href='http://sweatingdark.blogspot.com/2012/09/dangerous-liaisons.html' title='Dangerous Liaisons'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/09/dangerous-liaisons_9080.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/9138241838051777580'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/9138241838051777580'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8109507497119653484</id><published>2012-08-28T12:08:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.436-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Foodies</title><content type='html'>Just now a Noble Coffee barista described to me for the umpteenth time the coffees they're serving today. I realize this is part of her job, but as soon as she began enumerating flavor notes, my eyes unfocused and her words became a soup to my ears. I've been here often enough that I've technically heard detailed descriptions of each one of their coffees, but I can't remember anything about them. The only knowledge that has stuck is that their dark roasts nauseate me, whereas everything else is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There has been an explosion of gourmandise in the past decade. It has been an extremely verbose reboot of food as an aesthetic object. You might think that someone who never shuts up about food on this blog and who has stopped bothering with the nondescriptive language of recipes would be pleased with this revolution in gastronomic discourse. More and more people talk about food. But what do they say?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dylan Moran has this bit in his standup, on wine. (He is, too.) It's the model of what I just said about Noble's coffee: There are two kinds of wine, he says--the kind that make you go "mm, mm, that's ok, let's have eight of those," and the other kind: "jesus what is that?!" An uncle of mine calls the former kind "drinkable," and indeed, this is the highest compliment that one can give a wine. Moran's wine bit is exactly what this new logorrhea about food is not. The baristas at Noble are trained to go on about caramel, white peaches, charcoal, and fresh earth, but not to say anything about how the coffee hits you. These endless descriptions are pure cognition. Anything visceral gets lost. This is not taste for the sake of pleasure, but taste for taste's sake. Foodies are to food what birders are to birds. They discern, identify, catalog, and record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two friends who in their adolescence dated. One is a food snob, and the other is an aspiring food snob. They're still friends, and when they see each other they argue. He repeatedly tries foods he doesn't like to get himself to like them. She finds this ridiculous; if he doesn't like something then he doesn't like it--that's his taste. He counters that some things are acquired tastes, there are foods you don't like as a child but like as an adult. Yes, she argues, but you don't go out of your way to force yourself to try those foods again. She implies that her tastes are entirely natural, but she cultivates them. For both of them taste is mimetic, but for him it has a unidirectional relation to the body. He wants to like things because he's heard that people with taste like them. His body is supposed to behave, not speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll encounter this muteness if you ever dine with a foodie. He'll reverse engineer the dish for you, dissect its flavors, tell you if it meets his standards. It's a kind of magic trick, but while those performances appeal to the part of us that doesn't think and longs to be confounded, this is the babble of one cogito to another.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/08/foodies.html' title='Foodies'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/8109507497119653484/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/08/foodies.html#comment-form' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8109507497119653484'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8109507497119653484'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/08/foodies.html' title='Foodies'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-7594045091248748034</id><published>2012-08-27T16:30:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T15:39:03.446-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>Hackers</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://brightwalldarkroom.com/post/30321550855/hackers-1995"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Legacy of (Zero) Cool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Coolness has always slain me.

Yes, the person who would hear my recycled story probably hasn't read the blog post, but still I stop myself from bringing up the subject again. Nobody would know how limited my repertoire of potential entertainments really is, but I feel pathetic repeating what I wrote publicly. Like pulling something out of the back of the closet and wrapping it as a birthday gift. No, it's more than that; I'm preemptively ashamed of being that elder who happily and seemingly unwittingly repeats the same rotation of stories over and over. Except in this case over and over is twice. It also goes against this notion of mine that the dignified thing to do is to write one thing and live another, to forget what I've written when in conversation, or at least pretend to. And don't certain kinds of thought thrive in secrecy, or at the very least at an address the route to which is circuitous and indeterminate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said this, I may as well reverse the phenomenon that causes me such egoic anxiety and say what I repeat everywhere but in writing. Which is nothing special, really, although clearly I'm excited enough by what it says about me (what?) that I tell everyone every time I cut my finger making bread pudding. It has happened twice, but I think it has happened thrice. As with all injuries that are minor but more than a scratch, when the knife slips (predictably by now--I know that this knife and I are bound to meet in exactly this way yet every time I begin slicing I think that somehow, through no tangible precaucion, I will avoid it) there is a rush not just of shock and blood, but the thrill that what's happening now I can later report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's quite simple, the way it happens. Holding together sliced bread, especially stiff, stale bread, is a precarious thing. I cube the bread with a serrated knife. First I cut it one way, then another, and finally a third way. It is this third angle, when I am pressing the shifting columns of bread down so that they may be sliced finally into cubes, that something slips. I'm not sure what, to be honest, so maybe it isn't so simple. This last time I screamed, not so much in distress as in frustration. That growling scream of things escaping your ridiculous designs of control. (Equally ridiculous: I sometimes take it upon myself to disagree with the maxims of advertisements.  The other day a car ad said "the highest form of power is control," and I was like, yeah, as if!) Part of the scream was that--god &lt;em&gt;damn&lt;/em&gt; it--things went exactly as I expected but refused to admit. I have a friend who engages in many semidangerous activities and his reort to his worried mother (I'm equally worried, but usually say nothing) is that he takes deliberate precautions. It sounds very rational, the way he explains it. There are somethings you can't avoid, he admits, but most things you can reduce your chances of by thinking about, devising habits or plans of action around, and making a point to carrying those out. Yeah, sure, I always say, resigning myself to the impossibility of safety. Dealing with the details of trying to control fate gives me a headache. Hence I continue to cube bread in the same manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tell this tiny story, the humor I'm so thrilled about is the irony that bread pudding, something so innocuous and not at all difficult to make, is the most consistent source of bodily harm in my life. (At the moment that's not true; there is work, which provides a generous helping of scratches, small punctures, torn nails, and callouses on my hands that I must say I'm not at all a fan of. Those rock climbers that intentionally sandpaper their hands for extra grip must be vain in an entirely different way than I am. But then it's less about the appearance of my hands than it is the feeling, or rather the lack thereof. I rub my fingers together and get a thick nothing. This is disappointing.) This sense of humor is almost immediately tiresome to me, yet I repeat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like my recipe for bread pudding. Despite my slight disappoinment with the results every time (a bit too goopy and the egg is not very well integrated), I never really change the way I make it. Every time I go back to look at the recipe in  &lt;a href="http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/10/8-oz-stale-bread-bread-pudding-with.html"&gt;my previous blog post on bread pudding&lt;/a&gt;, letting it tell me the proportions of ingredients, although I never follow them exactly. It did turn out fairly well this morning, because there was no milk last night and I turned to condensed milk, which my father keeps cases of about the kitchen. I turn my nose at the use of the stuff in tea or coffee, but for bread pudding it is apparently superior to milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with myself for thinking to soak it overnight to bake it in the morning for breakfast, but I must tell you, in case you become enamored of the same plan, that bread pudding takes a long time to bake. How long? Long enough that coffee on an empty stomach began to feel like a kind of implosion of the viscera before the pudding was done. You will open the oven door frequently. You will dawdle on the computer as if in an airport. You will salivate. You will look at the time obsessively, although you will not know at what time you put the pudding in the oven, nor for how long to bake it. You will worry at first that there is too much liquid for the bread to absorb, and that it will turn out inedibly soggy. Then it will rise like a cake, and you will know that all is well. Wait, though, until it browns on the outside, because you never know what's going on on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bread is surprisingly resiliant; fingers are more fragile than you might expect. But fingers are not in any danger, really. It will only feel like danger, and though you will curse when something beneath the skin is torn, and every time in the future you make bread pudding you'll be afraid of it happening again, you also watch horror movies. (I don't, but not because I'm immune to their pleasures--after all I've stayed up in a terrified trance of episode after episode of the The X-Files until I finally fall asleep from sheer exhaustion. Which is another thing I repeat orally.) A hasty if self-consciously allusionary and untheorized explanation.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/08/slicing-bread-for-pudding.html' title='Slicing Bread for Pudding'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/4966099554027613426/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/08/slicing-bread-for-pudding.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4966099554027613426'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4966099554027613426'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/08/slicing-bread-for-pudding.html' title='Slicing Bread for Pudding'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-7900735849299675732</id><published>2012-08-12T21:29:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T15:39:03.447-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>Beasts of the Southern Wild</title><content type='html'>That I would see "Beasts" (as everyone buying tickets called it) was not at all certain. The trailer had induced an exasperated groan. A child's voice said "The whole universe depends on everything fitting together just right. If just one piece busts, even the smallest piece, the entire universe will get busted." At the words "get busted", it cuts to a shot of antarctic ice crashing into the ocean. Oh lord. Ecological fallacies for environmentalist campaigns are all well and good, but as a master narrative veiled as a child's wisdom, it grossed me out. Here was one more to add to my list of movies not to see, which has been growing unmanageably large lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there I was in front of the Varsity (the sense of this name eludes me), looking at showing times. I had just sat in the cafe above Bloomsbury (a far less opaque name for a bookshop), poking laconically at my keyboard at about one sentence every five minutes. Two cups of coffee, somehow, had given me ennui rather than the characteristic ballooning of the ego. I kept blaming various things. It was one of those days. The coffee was bad. The thick smoke that turned the light yellow and the mountains charred and hazy made me tired. (That which claims things as parts of an identity protested with desperate confusion: &lt;i&gt;but I like smoky days!&lt;/i&gt;) None of this changed the fact that I was undead, standing there in front of the theater. I saw that "Beasts" began in ten minutes. I looked at the other films. "Hope Springs", solely on the basis of its title--ew. "Moonrise Kingdom", STILL PLAYING--ew. "Savages", I'm not even sure what that is, but I guess Blake Lively's agent has found ways to try to keep her career from dying after the last season of Gossip Girl ends next year, although honestly I think it's the rest of the cast who might need to worry. Something with Jack Black--ew. I had not watched trailers for any of these. At least with "Beasts" I understood what kind of ew I was getting into. What the hell, I thought, I have a regular source of income for the time being, I'll spend $6.50 on ew. Who knows, maybe the trailer's barely obfuscated environmentalist moralizing totally misrepresented the film. Maybe I'd even like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were some things to like. But my urgent need to urinate halfway through sent me to the bathroom, rather than willing myself to stay in my seat for the last 45 minutes. One thing I liked was the epigrammatic speech the fisherwoman cum voodoo practitioner cum mother to lost children gave to her little flock. She slaps a red mess of glistening red crayfish in front of the camera. "Animals are made of meat. You're meat. I'm meat." (She goes on to name a number of familiar farmyard animals.) The film is constantly daring the audience to be comfortable with their own fleshiness. This off-the-grid estuarine community appears to live solely on meat and booze. The ritual back at Hushpuppy's (the child star of the film, who I also liked) home is: Her father slaps a freshly slaughtered chicken on the grill, rings a bell and yells "feed up time!" She rushes off to eat, making her way among a chaos of chickens, goats, and pigs. In her voiceover narration she refers to everyone as an animal, not distinguishing humans. Actually, the voiceover is less narration than a collection of pithy, extremely general teachings, like a tiny, impractical Sun Tzu. She does, however, introduce her community in voiceover, known as The Bathtub. She says of this primitivist wet dream that "Daddy says The Bathtub celebrates more holidays than anywhere else," and we are given a montage of Bathtubians hollering from a parade float that could've been made at Burning Man, swilling booze, playing with fireworks. I was given the impression of people trying very hard to convince themselves they were having a good time, and I was not at all sure this was the intended effect. The music was joyful during these celebrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the deliberate gross-out provocations of the camera (look at all this meat), I think The Bathtub is supposed to ultimately look like a noble alternative to late capitalism. This story divides the world in two: the people in the city, and the people in the Bathtub. The plot revolves around the city people constructing a levee that raises the water level and sinks The Bathtub. It is this artifice to which Hushpuppy refers when she says that something busts. (That shot of the ice crumbling gets carted at the same moment in the film as in the trailer, to my disappointment.) The trouble with the philosophy that Hushpuppy develops of a perfect universe that busts is that, honey, the universe is always already busted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film points to complications in the future rather than the past. As our drunken Bathtubians try to put the world back to the way it was, everything just keeps going more wrong. They blow a hole in the levee with dynamite, only to find that their home is half dead and muddy after all that time underwater. Then the city people forcibly evacuate them with helicopters to a hospital. The Bathtubians soon escape from this nightmare ward where sick people are "plugged into the wall", in what I guess is supposed to be a triumphant rebellion against a civilizing mission. The busting of their home is mirrored in Hushpuppy's father's health. "My blood," he says, in a rare moment of nondenial, "is eating itself." Which is a poetic way to talk about an autoimmune disorder, but that, ultimately, is what grates: the artifice of these voices posed as authentic alterity. It is the "Forrest Gump" problem: having someone simple speak your half-baked philosophies makes them sound profound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That, and how distant these characters ultimately are to us. Chances are, the audience lives in the capitalist world this community so vehemently rejects. Like a Jean Jeunet film, we are entrated to love this band of misfits. They're rough, drunk, and scary, and yet they're drowning in cute. The problem is, we may all be animals, but animals have this thing planted in the animal: a mind. This is a film convinced that the solution to the mind-body problem, and to every other binary opposition, is to privilege the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;~&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has come to my attention, via &lt;a href="http://www.filmcomment.com/article/beasts-of-the-southern-wild-behn-zeitlin"&gt;an article in Film Comment&lt;/a&gt; that I spotted while waiting for my brother to finish reading Backpacker in the periodical section of the public library, that Benh Zeitlin (the filmmaker, who I'm sure would scrupulously reject this title) may not have fashioned all of the contours of Bathtubian speech in the image of his own romantic vision of how simple folk should live. (Incidentally, there are a number of backpackers about town this weekend. The herd of Pacific Crest Trail hikers, brought on, as my brother deduced, by the recent publication of &lt;i&gt;Wild&lt;/i&gt;, are all at this point in their journey. Four of them entered the library in the twenty minutes we spent there. They generally come in what I assume are romantic pairs, with tiny packs carrying virtually nothing. Their food is cached at several points along the trail. I still wonder at the logistics of this, just as the gritty realism of "Beasts" makes me wonder where they get all their booze and breakfast cereal to feed the chickens. Maybe I just can't handle magical realism. In any case, trade does not exist in this film, but its artifacts seem to undergird the Bathtubians' alternative society. This turns their moralizing about The Big Bad City, to my mind, like the whiny urgings of dumpster divers to bring down The System.) In this article, in which he is interviewed in New Orleans, he says he had to "revise toward the people"--that is, revise his script to the actors' lives, mannerisms, etc. (He also says that the film came out of an epiphany he had in Europe that he "didn't want to be an expat", yet he moved to New Orleans. As much as the article declaims Hollywood tendencies to exoticize that city, I think it's safe to say that those "clichés about black magic and magical negroes" are precisely why Zeitlin has planted himself there, and what animates the fantastical in "Beasts".) He likes to think of the process as "organic". He says "&lt;quote&gt;I think it was hard for people, people who don’t know this city and this region, to understand how deep the roots go and how impossible it is to transplant what’s here to somewhere else."&lt;/quote&gt;His film has failed to translate to "people who don't know this city" the deep roots of its characters, instead leaving them, well, floating. The mystery that drew Zeitlin to the Mississippi delta has been preserved, or missed entirely--your pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes yes, the beasts. There are in fact beasts, which occupy a parallel cinematic universe for most of the film, a bit like the hilariously nonsequitor dinosaurs in "The Tree of Life" (but then in that film, what isn't a nonsequitor). The Aurochs, tattooed on The Bathtub's resident earth mother goddess's arm, are said to eat people. They are, then, the animal that busts our supremacy over the animal world. They also look like pigs. Sort of cute, gentle-eyed pigs, with snuffling snouts. They have big tusks, yes, and they allegedly eat their kin (I know, I'm wading into a big pool of muck by selectively distrusting parts of the fictional world), as well as trample stuff. Anyway, they bow to Hushpuppy at the end. I guess we were expecting them to do something bad, seeing as they were loosed from the ice by the catastrophic storm (Katrina). I think I missed the point. I stopped following the metaphoric register about halfway though.</content><link rel='related' href='http://sweatingdark.blogspot.com/2012/08/beasts-of-southern-wild.html' title='Beasts of the Southern Wild'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/7900735849299675732/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/08/beasts-of-southern-wild_6191.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7900735849299675732'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7900735849299675732'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/08/beasts-of-southern-wild_6191.html' title='Beasts of the Southern Wild'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-9065563367399020556</id><published>2012-08-12T00:06:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.470-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Anya's Thai Bistro</title><content type='html'>Some are silent because they're silent, others are silent because they have high expectations of speech. My cousin is afflicted with this taciturnity in all communicative acts, including cooking. He lives therefore suspended on his way to a perfect utterance, a perfect dish. Well, perhaps the former is my own particular problem, whereas his metaphysical ambition plays out culinarily. For now he's the pastry chef at Amuse, and in the same kitchen makes all of the ice cream for Mix. He was recently asked by someone who has a tendency to imbue everyone with (extra)ordinary ambitions if he would like to one day start a his own restaurant. He reworded this wistful inquiry into something certain: "I will." I laughed because I was won over by the earnestness of his ambition&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His face is stern, yet vulnerable with youthfulness. He asked for a beer when we were out for dinner at Kobe, and the waitress shot back "are you old enough, honey?" His pale skin made his blush all the more raw. His temperament--which some interpret as easygoing calm--is such that after a moment he said "that's quite a 'tude," and when asked, said that no, he would not hire her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asking such a serious soul for his opinion of a restaurant is a treat. He considers judiciously, and is careful not to taint his answer with what he considers to be personal bias. He said of the new Thai place in town, furrowing his brow and lowering his voice (though it already rumbles low from his narrow frame), that it has a small menu of "simple food" that's "very authentic." By "simple food" (a phrase he uses often) he means to distinguish it from fine dining, but also to commend its decency. There's a bit of a passive-aggressive jab in calling it "simple food," yet his aesthetic, I gather, is something like simplicity. For a recent family gathering he made a sauce of slowly sautéed slices of red pepper and onion in olive oil, something that is also done at Amuse. At amuse, he said, they use a lot of spices, but he just used salt and pepper. He didn't give any indication which he preferred, but personally I'm for his version. From anyone else I would've rolled my eyes at "authentic", but I sensed he meant something specific rather than magical. He simply meant that the food was closer to what he tasted in Thailand than it was to Thai Pepper, a restaurant that strains to be innovative and upmarket. Then again, maybe my brain was mush. While his short oral review was not glowing, exactly, a considerable excitement for this place had been transferred to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of what he said about Anya's, I walked in to its low cavern of a dining room with a kind of serenity. The space appeared to me through a mist of sentimental trust, as in at that stage of infatuation when anything the other says is beautiful. Following this simile, you'd think I'm about to say that in retrospect everything was crap and the things that mesmerized me, empty. Not exactly. But then I have yet to have a second date, which I plan to. I have a rendezvous planned with sticky rice and mango.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I developed an amused affection for the place. Surrounded by empty shops, the room had a quiet romance to it. There were a few other full tables, none of them exasperatingly boisterous or scarily quiet. The lighting seemed soft, in part because of the sizzling sounds from the kitchen, which soothed. The kitchen was just behind a counter that reached up to the chef's waist, and from my seat I had a view of vegetables searing in small rounded pans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell, they have a crew of three: Anya the chef, her husband the waiter and host, and a large man in chef pants and Crocs, who I assume assists Anya. The arrangement doesn't fit easily into the roles that divide the labor of a restaurant. Anya apparently takes orders when she can (or perhaps when she feels like it). Her husband does all the service: greeting, bussing, taking orders. Their assistant must do dishes as well as helping cook. I think we met Anya. She was efficient, as her husband theatrically exclaimed on his way back to her behind the counter. He eagerly came to wait on our table, apologizing that we hadn't yet received menus, only to discover that we had already placed our orders with his wife. "She's so quick!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The husband (I didn't catch his name) in his somewhat flustered way was eager to please. I couldn't help but read this as the desperation of someone treading financial water. Businesses down here never last for long. They're easily forgotten. Only when I heard that Anya's was here did I remember that I had heard a couple years ago that The Underground Market existed. Now it's gone, along with everything else except for Anya's. The emptied out shop spaces that surround the tables give the place a certain allure just as they made me worry for its fate. Here I was happily removed from the normal functioning of Ashland's commercially saturated downtown. It was a bit like being backstage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through my misted gaze I was enamored of the food, although it helped that there was variety to sample between the four of us. About halfway through my ample bowl of pad thai, its flavor was no longer a flavor. But that's true of just about anything you eat that much of. Everything, I thought, had a freshness. Thai restaurants have this tendency to devolve into rich, slightly sweet masses of whatever. You begin piling oily glue into your gullet. Here the flavors remained distinct, and the vegetables crisp yet piping hot. The chopsticks had a purpose other than making Americans feel cool, allowing you to pick up and sample individual chunks of tomato, bell pepper, chicken, broccoli. (Yeah, I heard that somewhere, and it's not specific to Anya's at all. One could do the same thing with a fork, but we have a tendency to use that instrument as a shovel.) The Thai tea seemed to cater to the tastes of Ashlanders, who say "not too sweet" as praise. I wished for overpoweringly syrupy tea on principle, but then I had to admit I enjoyed this modulated stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we left, Anya's husband made sure to send us off with "see you next time!"</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/08/anyas-thai-bistro.html' title='Anya&amp;#39;s Thai Bistro'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/9065563367399020556/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/08/anya-thai-bistro.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/9065563367399020556'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/9065563367399020556'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/08/anya-thai-bistro.html' title='Anya&amp;#39;s Thai Bistro'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4992183723958442994</id><published>2012-08-09T23:46:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.384-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Lunch</title><content type='html'>I hate my lunches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every other time I've worked (seldom) it's been somewhere far-flung enough that if I din't bring a lunch, I was fucked. (That's how I put it to my coworkers; that is how one puts things in a hard hat, apparently.) On jobs in the middle of nowhere, I worried constantly about lunch. Afternoons driving back wondering if I needed to shop for tomorrow's lunch; evenings taking inventory of the kitchen, either literally or mentally, from some horizontal pose; nights re-cataloguing the evening's information into something to eat; mornings trying to remember not to forget to prepare and pack; lunchtimes eating not to want to eat later and overdoing it, turning my guts into a pendulous weight, splashing excess up into my esophagus. Of course, the future tense's reign over my consciousness gets periodically overthrown while regularly employed. Worrying about lunch turns quickly into falling into lunch, lapsing into going out the door, remembering, maybe, eventually, to sleep. Waking up becomes the bends, when the excesses of this slippery new relationship with time slap down all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, lunch was one of those unavoidable realities. Working within two blocks of downtown and two blocks from a supermarket, it isn't really. I don't bother to pack lunch from home. Whatever. Instead, I walk to the store, and among a plethora of options get more or less the same thing every time, and I'm beginning to loathe it. But then, you know I love to loathe. Every time I get a roll, a piece of cheese (there's a bucket of leftover small pieces to save me from letting a larger block rot in my backpack through the afternoon), and some kind of fruit: a smoothie, a couple of plums, a banana. Unlike the nervous gorging of before, this lunch programme is never quite enough. Yet what small item do I fill it out with? I never know. Chips? A soda? A carrot? With a few small variations (whole wheat roll vs sourdough roll, havarti vs cheddar that sticks to the top of my mouth vs tiny wedge of brie) I still keep eating the same thing every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my written prose spills disgustingly into my speech, like the smell of the mold spores puffing out of the rice cooker when the door is opened for the first time in weeks. Others' spillages, too, resemble what is new yet ossified. Nevermind 'technology', cyborgs can be of habit. Imagine not Locutus but those cheesy Torchwood lumberers as speech orders itself with a giveaway jitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, who cares what spills and hardens into brittle? (It's rhetorical, but: clean freaks.) The compulsion to aestheticize needs to die, it's so ugly.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/08/lunch.html' title='Lunch'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/4992183723958442994/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/08/lunch.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4992183723958442994'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4992183723958442994'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/08/lunch.html' title='Lunch'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8942388901768499603</id><published>2012-08-07T00:52:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.462-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Sneha Rajaram Posts</title><content type='html'>I am no cook, but sometimes I get a mad scientist urge to try out something new. Being on a diet for my apparently stagnant liver adds enough challenge to interest me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;My boyfriend has a liver problem too, and we get all diseases together, which some would say means my liver isn’t the only stagnant thing in this story. So when he started salivating at all the cupcakes and sponge cakes out of our dietary reach in the supermarket, I decided to Bake a Cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;First problem was sugar, which I wanted to substitute with jaggery (I seem to remember something about molasses in my sixth grade project about the “American Revolution”, but I could be mistaken). So the possibly historically significant jaggery, combined with racist-Gerald-Durrell’s-Corfu-conjuring olive oil (monounsaturated fatty acid, a term I learnt yesterday) instead of butter, and egg whites only. So far so good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;For the flour, I decided to use ragi (finger millet) flour, which however when eaten by itself, tastes too organic even for my pretentions to rural, traditional, “natural” food. Ragi balls are the traditional South Indian farmers’ and labourers’ food, fêted now by New Age dieticians, and hence politically deeply suspect to me. Not to mention their dense undifferentiated texture makes them cleave to the roof of my mouth and disallows mitigation through any kind of spice or sauce, making my paranoid mind think someone &lt;i&gt;wants&lt;/i&gt; to out me as the spoilt urban refined-flour-eating inverted snob that I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;I looked around and found some lentil flour, which I added confidently because I once mistook it for refined wheat flour and the cake that emerged thereof was edible. And a bit of oats for good measure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Oh, and I mashed some bananas with my hand because I love to feel the stuff ooze from between my fingers. Added those too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Then I “beat” the batter with my hands again in the absence of a blender, and it came out way too dark brown (damn ragi again), like it was the very organic Mother Earth that sustains us all. Trying to ignore my cake making fun of me (no mean feat), I proceeded to pour it into a stainless steel vessel (ungreased, of course, I forgot), and put it into a pressure cooker, this being the closest thing I have to an oven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Having always steamed stuff in a pressure cooker before, I wasn’t sure whether to put water in or not. More worrying for someone who grew up with a physicist parent was the rubber gasket that expands with heat and makes the thing airtight. I see rubber gaskets and think of the O-rings of the Challenger, which Feynman’s post-mortem team found were responsible for its crash. I wasn’t sure if the gasket would burn if I didn’t use water. I put the gasket in, sniffing for burning rubber in the first few minutes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;But apparently cake (if I may call it that) burns faster than rubber. Smelling it beginning to burn, I put in water and took out the gasket so I wouldn’t get steamed cake. Then a rattling, poltergeist racket penetrated to the bedroom and I rushed to find my best stainless steel vessel dancing an angry jig inside the cooker, tossed by the boiling water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;I haven’t used my cooker recently, so I hadn’t predicted this. The expensive organic brown basmati rice my sister very sweetly bought for my diet turned out to take forever to cook in it, and by the time I figured out I had to soak it first, I was tired of using the cooker. My boyfriend suggested I try it on the squirrel outside, and I said no, it only eats peanuts (this was my vanity speaking, it actually ate half a peanut when I tried to give it a handful, and all my Enid Blyton dreams of squirrels and nuts died an early death). However, the squirrel ended up eating a handful of that expensive brown basmati rice faster than I’ve seen anyone eat anything. So now I’m reduced to the dilemma of worldly wastage of expensive food vs. unworldly satisfaction of our gourmet squirrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-r8guPkWioS0/UCDJgya0CeI/AAAAAAAAEdM/w13EfRklbUA/s1600/2012-08-06+13.56.19.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-r8guPkWioS0/UCDJgya0CeI/AAAAAAAAEdM/w13EfRklbUA/s400/2012-08-06+13.56.19.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The last question: what to do with the egg yolk? I cooked it very crudely on the gas without oil just for solidity and hence portability, and packed it to appease the stray dogs in the neighbourhood who let me through in the daytime but get really territorial at night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Anticlimax: Protection money taken care of, the cake was done and it came out okay. A bit pretentious-tasting, and a bit dry, but otherwise pretty good. The secret? I used very inorganic, toxic to the liver, good old baking soda. That stuff’ll make anything into a cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sneha may also be found on &lt;a href="http://bitedribble.wordpress.com/"&gt;Bite &amp;amp; Dribble&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.in/2012/02/guest-post-by-sneha-rajaram.html"&gt;her other post on this blog&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.tehelka.com/story_main51.asp?filename=Ws281211Rogue.asp"&gt;over here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/08/sneha-rajaram-posts.html' title='Sneha Rajaram Posts'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/8942388901768499603/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/08/sneha-rajaram-posts.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8942388901768499603'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8942388901768499603'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/08/sneha-rajaram-posts.html' title='Sneha Rajaram Posts'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-r8guPkWioS0/UCDJgya0CeI/AAAAAAAAEdM/w13EfRklbUA/s72-c/2012-08-06+13.56.19.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-7059336608727374488</id><published>2012-07-29T03:01:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T15:39:03.443-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>"Damages" Season 5 Episode 3</title><content type='html'>Every season of "Damages" fictionalizes some real-life scandal. This fifth season, the material is Wikileaks and the sexual charges against Julian Assange. My understanding of this material is, as with every other season's, limited. But it was the first season whose references I broadly understood, which had me giddy in the same way a birder identifies the bird in front of him. That is to say, cursorily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot of this season combines Assange's sexuality and the functioning of WikiLeaks. That word, leak, echoes around as a kind of innuendo, until in the third episode it reaches a pitch of conflation. Sitting on the toilet taking a leak, I come to the depressing realization that all of my thoughts on the matter of leakage hinge on an Anne Carson essay--depressing not because, gosh, thoughts come from somewhere, but because I've come to the conclusion that every essay that uses Anne Carson's work does so in the manner of quoting gospel, and &lt;a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/loving-franko-b/"&gt;the effect upon the essay is invariably death&lt;/a&gt;. She is so unassailably cool in the eyes of certain people (of whom I'm one) that she cannot be quoted without taking over as sole purveyor of meaning. Which is why it is better here to instead cite a glaring plot point. The "whistleblower", as those who supply information to the Assange analog are called, is a woman whose leak, when it gets leaked onto his website, for some reason contains personal emails detailing her, as a newspaper puts it, sexcapade. The leak, ostensibly about the leakiness of her company, is also, through some unidentified leak, about her sexual leakiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I say leak one more time, I'll kill myself. Which is what the "whistleblower" almost but did not do in response to hers. In the events leading up to her death, she and whatever his name is meet in a hotel room, against protocol, to discuss the information she is to supply. He assures her that it will be confidential, then comes onto her. She pushes him away, and then says that "I'm afraid this isn't something I can follow through on" "What isn't?" he asks, and she says "the leak" (saving me, happily), but in what comes out of his mouth immediately afterwards it is not clear what, or rather which: "You think I can't take what I want?", "I think this is what you wanted", "If I give you what you want will you give me what I want?" (As he unbuttons his pants and forces her onto the bed.) I believe I've made my point as clear and articulate as a blog post demands. As for the show, what exactly is being said is unclear to me, but it sure is bludgeoning it into us.</content><link rel='related' href='http://sweatingdark.blogspot.com/2012/07/damages-season-5-episode-3.html' title='&amp;quot;Damages&amp;quot; Season 5 Episode 3'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/7059336608727374488/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/07/season-5-episode-3_632.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7059336608727374488'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7059336608727374488'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/07/season-5-episode-3_632.html' title='&amp;quot;Damages&amp;quot; Season 5 Episode 3'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4883607401495733517</id><published>2012-07-26T17:45:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.379-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Potatoes Fried in Fat</title><content type='html'>There are rules to cooking, but you can't follow them. Foremost among them is: Nothing ever goes according to plan. Understanding this rule is not precisely fruitful. Planning for plans to go awry is futile hubris. The best you can hope for is flexibility of some sort; to stick to the plan is generally worse than making a new one. The original plan, however, isn't so easily left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my way home today I had an impulse, brought on by the sweet-spoken words of a "Chopped" contestant from Texas: "nothing's better than potatoes fried in duck fat." I doubted I would easily find duck, and if I did, I doubted I would want to pay for it. Duck, in my plan, became chicken. I would find either chicken drumsticks or chicken wings, melt the fat from their skins, and fry potatoes in that grease. At the store, however, the only chicken parts for sale with skin attached were drumsticks in huge, 5lb packages. (Having already that day visited The Food Co-op, where chicken parts of all kinds come in small packages, I went to Safeway--too embarrassed at the prospect of returning to the Co-op.) Instead I bought a pork shoulder steak. It appeared well-endowed with fat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At home, I chopped potatoes and half a yellow zucchini. I salted the pork steak and seared it on both sides, thinking that the latter would lead to an effusion of grease, but the pan remained dry. What was the best temperature for melting fat? I wondered. It was at this point I had to give up my dream of potatoes soaked in hot animal fat. A few tablespoons of olive oil went in, along with the potatoes and a splash of water. Covered with the heat low, it became a braise. Some fresh thyme leaves, salt, and black pepper were sprinkled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about ten minutes the zucchini was in. Not long after, the meat was out--it was already done, and--sliced into--it was good. I wanted to eat the whole thing before any of the vegetables were done. I held back, wanting still to have a semblance of what I had imagined: everything together on a plate. To the imagined dish I still clung. I removed the lid, trying to boil off all the liquid and thereby return the potatoes and zucchini to frying. It was taking a long time, but it was working. Everything was browning and sticking to the bottom of the pan. The zucchini became soft and that was my cue, in my impatience, to eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor was marvelous. Well, sort of. The pork had an unidentifiable, sickly taint, but the potatoes and zucchini were coated in something delicious. The zucchini was overcooked, mushy, and falling apart--while half the potatoes were undercooked and still unpleasantly hard. Biting into my first unexpectedly raw chunk of potato, I thought again of potatoes perfectly crisped and cooked through in duck fat. (Which is not something I've ever eaten, mind you.) This mess of textures in front of me wasn't what I had in mind, but in its shortcomings the ideal kept resurfacing. A bite of potato blocked by unyielding flesh is perhaps better than a bite perfectly cooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is this moment of eerie stereoscopy. Yes, the plate before me is there, and I eat it, but the other plate, the one I imagined, is there too, its golden potatoes generously shiny. The mind refuses to acknowledge what is before it, and goes off chasing a ghost. Which isn't to say it's less real. I couldn't tell you what the real dish I cooked tastes like any more than I could the dish I saw on television.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-liKCRSummwM/UBHkiH-15AI/AAAAAAAAEc0/AJIMKEEHieY/s1600/IMG_1133-001.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-liKCRSummwM/UBHkiH-15AI/AAAAAAAAEc0/AJIMKEEHieY/s400/IMG_1133-001.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/07/potatoes-fried-in-fat.html' title='Potatoes Fried in Fat'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/4883607401495733517/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/07/potatoes-fried-in-fat.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4883607401495733517'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4883607401495733517'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/07/potatoes-fried-in-fat.html' title='Potatoes Fried in Fat'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-liKCRSummwM/UBHkiH-15AI/AAAAAAAAEc0/AJIMKEEHieY/s72-c/IMG_1133-001.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4255827550989424971</id><published>2012-07-24T23:50:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T15:39:03.407-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>Batman The Third</title><content type='html'>I've always been lured into the pleasures of watching movies already made sense of by a piece of writing, but it's always folly. Whether it's the gentler stuff of movie reviews, or the cocaine of academia, either I'm miffed (because the movie failed to live up to the exemplarity it was made to be in writing), or I keep up the same irritatingly mimicking zeal that the article sent me to the theater with. Well, okay--usually it's a queasy cohabitation of the two. Any kind of synthesis is out of the question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was sent off to "Brave" with the promise of a smile by &lt;a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/just-another-princess-movie/"&gt;an analysis that tied the whole movie together&lt;/a&gt;, I hung to Batman (I mean "The Dark Knight Rises", if you can swallow that) by the thread dangling off the end of &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2012/07/30/120730crci_cinema_lane?currentPage=all"&gt;Anthony Lane's review&lt;/a&gt;. (Unlike Batman himself, who, while perilously strung throughout the movie for dramatic effect, is that which wins, &lt;a href="http://projectnes.blogspot.com/2010/04/holy-ontological-narrative-concepts.html"&gt;we know&lt;/a&gt;. Surviving a nuclear blast, as he does at the end of the film--appearing like an American Jesus of The Good Life to Michael Caine, who makes a good stand-in for Mary Magdalene--is surely confirmation of this definition.) Having since the second movie petulantly rolled my eyes at the high-falutin seriousness that plagues this trilogy, Lane had given me high expectations for Cat Woman as precisely that element of ridicule. She is fun, but it occurred to me about the time she straddles Batman's motorcycle in skin-tight black, that Lane's article simply needed a closing twist, and the movie needed female eye candy. However, Anne Hathaway &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the most entertaining part of a movie that otherwise does little else but beat drums in your ears for two hours. She has the cleverest lines, for one thing--maybe the only speech that's even written to engage us. While every other muscle-bound orator drones on (or, as the case may be, whispers, or speaks into a malfunctioning loudspeaker) about souls, fear, privilege, and power, she's amused, and almost leaves the doomed little island that Gotham becomes to save herself. There, there's my imitative little fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds vaguely believable, but honestly I couldn't even follow most what she was saying, either. The plot was hazy to me. I think there was some big twist toward the end, as Marion Cotillard's knife twisted in Christian Bale. Turns out it was her who as a child escaped the prison, instead of Bane, the gurgling, mouthless villain. Okay. So I guess her and Bruce Wayne's little fling was a farce, but we knew that, in different terms. In any case, what, after all the explosions, dystopia, growling (and did I mention the drumming?), was the denouement?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is for the first half a thick sense of portent brewed around Bane, while he remains underground the city. I don't mean so much the bits of dialog in which everyone worries about that crazy man in the sewers, but how the movie seems to cinematically strain to build this man's threat to a mysterious extreme. His mission is occluded enough at first that some sort of event seems sure to come, as if Nolan is screaming at us "SOMETHIN' GONNA HAPPEN HERE!" What happens? He gets himself a nuclear bomb. Any emergence this movie's emergency may have had just vanished. It is as this point I lost interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The "darkest" part of the film, then, coincided with my lowest. Bane became a surface-dweller, and proceeded to tear shit up like an adolescent's fantasy of revolution (release the prisoners! kill the rich!). Indeed, beside me, my brother was aping all this. He giggled, I think, at the shots of torn-up American flags, as if this was some profound ideological statement. He acknowledged it was all silliness when the lights came on, but as it unfolded in the dark I could tell he was thinking like one of those people whose idol is Tyler Durden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, the on-screen gunfire sent me into paranoiac imaginings of the sensation of a bullet entering my skull. When the lights were dimming and the movie began, the man in front of us turned conspicuously around, seeming to inspect the platform from which an Aurora imitator might target the theater. Perhaps this fear is why the movie's attempts at terror disconcertingly struck home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what's left? Should we look to the wisdom of Robin's take on all this? He resigns from the police, saying to the commissioner by way of explanation "you know what you said about structure becoming shackles? You're right--I mean, who's going to know who saved Gotham?" The trouble with the Law, apparently, is that it prevents (super) heroes from public recognition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only conclusion I can possibly come to is that "The Dark Knight Rises" has abandoned the project of adding up to anything. The noise, the darkness, the talk of class and privilege, the violence, the tests of mettle, the mushroom cloud, the resurrection: it doesn't mean anything. Stepping out of the theater, my brother said &lt;a href="http://www.shaviro.com/Blog/?p=1003"&gt;it was awesome&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='related' href='http://sweatingdark.blogspot.com/2012/07/batman-third.html' title='Batman The Third'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/4255827550989424971/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/07/batman-third_2127.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4255827550989424971'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4255827550989424971'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/07/batman-third_2127.html' title='Batman The Third'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-2219361680489174903</id><published>2012-07-21T23:25:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:59:15.962-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>Chopped</title><content type='html'>In Magic: The Gathering there is a card called Meekstone. It makes life difficult for anything large. It manipulates the rules to privilege the small, the creatures you wouldn't expect to make it or to do much of anything. An oddly negative card for the righteous (it's white, the color of piety), it does so by punishing the bold player who puts down something quite clearly intended to win. Winning must be done cryptically, through a guise of defense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this cutthroat world some of us morally-inclined goody-goodies might wish for a Meekstone, something to make effective our agonizing qualms. We think, by way of self-justification, that the concept of humility is not still at work in the wider moral culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowhere is this more apparent than "Chopped". The show, I am fairly sure, encourages its contestants to boast on camera. Then they get chopped. There are gradations and flavors of vocal hubris. The first episode I watched had a young Boston chef whose cold eyes glowered out from deep eye sockets. At every moment he told us how confident he was of his cooking. While one of his competitors--a French woman with an earthy aesthetic--flipped out, vocalized her every worry and mistake, and thought out loud in French-accented English, he excercised a rigid, aspirational control. He was constantly &lt;i&gt;saying&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;he was in control. It was such pleasure to watch him get chopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not every boaster is so clearly straining. Some really seem to believe their self-aggrandizements. These are the sort who tell us in the mandatory post-exile interview that they disagree with the choice to chop them. They tell us that they're the better chef. Usually these are older men, curmudgeonly and arrogant. I love to dislike them, and the show gives ample opportunity to ridicule them. A worthy chef does not say how great he or she is. A worthy chef is humble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't decide whether my favorite winner is the taciturn lawyer-turned-chef whose poise was immaculate, neither boasting nor caving under pressure, maintaining a calm poker face, or the Hannah Horvath of chefs, who moved to New York penniless with culinary dreams, and lives with her friend. Of course, Hannah wouldn't burst into tears at everything and anything. This contestant was not shy about describing how her anxiety felt. She said she felt like "throwing up" or "crying in a corner" or "I was having a nervous breakdown." She cried in interviews, she cried when critiqued, she cried when she won.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/07/chopped.html' title='Chopped'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/2219361680489174903/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/07/chopped.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2219361680489174903'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2219361680489174903'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/07/chopped.html' title='Chopped'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4718641114052557723</id><published>2012-07-16T16:45:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.374-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>In Private</title><content type='html'>For exaltation my memory is effectively very short. Anything that is good is The Best Thing Ever until there is something else. The nicest meal I've ever had is, I suspect, something only to happen and be appreciated in solitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some would find the presentation too artful; they insist that all food be slopped on a plate (or piled into a bowl) without intention. To them, artifice is to be sniffed out and slandered, and they posit that absolute accidence is possible, like a grungy teenager trying to find the zero-degree of unkempt. They would ridicule the way the egg is nestled carefully atop a mound of yellow zucchini, but they would not say so outright. "Oh, &lt;i&gt;very fancy&lt;/i&gt;," they would say, beaming at their plate and emitting hyperbolic oohs and ahhs. They would not intend to mock, but haplessly it would slip through the surface of their praise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others would poke at the oily squash distrustfully, smiling, wondering where the meat and potatoes are. But they, too, would not say this. Although vegetarianism has passed through several phases of It and Not, they wouldn't want to be so far behind the times as to dismiss it entirely. Some of their best friends are vegetarians. One must embrace all things; nothing is bad or wrong, not even personally, just different. Trying to prove themselves adaptable, they would grab hold of a sturdy rung of relativism. "Mmm, it's quite good," they would say, "I like zucchini," leaving half their portion of that vegetable on their plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still others would find a dish of just two items--dividing food into items as they do--unfit, following the rigid, contemporary notion that what makes a meal is a protein, a starch, and a vegetable. Always this prefix of "a". Without starch what is it? A snack perhaps. They would finish their sunny plate with gusto, finding it charming, amusing, and then expectantly wait for the next course. Maybe, if I had any, I would find them some bread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it is not a dish I would serve. I wouldn't &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; it in company either. It wouldn't occur to me to do so. With others my imagination doesn't reach to pleasure myself with things untried, but scurries among the staid for something that might displeasure everyone least. On the other hand, if I &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; trying to impress rather than comfort, I would do something flashy--which sauteed zucchini and poached egg is decidedly not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;If I served it to me, though, I would think it has too much olive oil and would prefer butter, I would want another egg, would revel in the simple seasoning of salt and black pepper, congratulate myself on the softened but not mushy zucchini, delight in this newfound pleasure, the poached egg, which happily lacks those automobile qualities of the fried egg--rubber and grease--and I might make it again sometime. But that's always a questionable urge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3iE3jYYz2OI/UASmSIn0sEI/AAAAAAAAEcg/aujPk05Jm2U/s1600/IMG_1131.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="297" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3iE3jYYz2OI/UASmSIn0sEI/AAAAAAAAEcg/aujPk05Jm2U/s400/IMG_1131.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/07/in-private.html' title='In Private'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/4718641114052557723/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/07/in-private.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4718641114052557723'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4718641114052557723'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/07/in-private.html' title='In Private'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3iE3jYYz2OI/UASmSIn0sEI/AAAAAAAAEcg/aujPk05Jm2U/s72-c/IMG_1131.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-699132257448970626</id><published>2012-07-15T21:19:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.399-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>More Short Recipes</title><content type='html'>On a hot day, chill a peach.

I know I could've just asked you for the recipe, but that would've defeated the point. Besides, as I kept harping on while we ate, recipes are useless without instruction of another sort. You can't exactly show me how you made it. So I did what I always do: impatiently skim the first few Google hits, omitting any ingredient I don't understand. Most noteably in this case, tomato paste. Isn't tomato a bully of a flavor in a sauce of wine? I think the vocabulary a restaurant critic might use is that the tomato would "deepen the flavor", or perhaps "broaden". These spacial metaphors. Well, my sauce is an empty room then, with a puddle of wine on the floor and some greasy chicken splattering the walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't mind the supposed minimalism in the mouth, though. It was, admittedly, filled out (there's another one, caprciously sprinkled to goad your characteristic optimism that spacialization isn't integral to language) with carrots and celery. But tasting my sauce now, in retrospect I detect the fullness of tomato in yours. The wine you used was also, I think, less fruity. The bottle I used was brought by my uncle, and its label described its final blast of berries as "elegant", which makes me suspect they know it isn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, while I was quite happy with my hapless foray into coq au vin, and was in some ways pleased with how it deviated from what I remember, it seems that yours was expertly executed. In fact, having perused a few recipes, your rendition seems so to-the-letter that I wonder if you actually bought it from the hot deli of Whole Foods. They have such things, don't they? If this is the case you might be amused, if not I imagine you're at least a little offended. You've never really been one to let anything get to you, although I suspect you're just very good at acting unperturbable. Which may be the same thing, really--something has to bother you in the first place for you to have any hand in keeping it at bay. Blissful ignorance is quite different from deliberate control, and I think with you it's probably the latter. This faithlessness on my part is usual, but only because I'm compensating for my gullibility. The truth is I'm just as dubious of doubt as I am of easy verity, which is another way of saying I'm utterly lost. I've never been sure how one might think or even intuit these things through, leaving me with wide-eyed credulity on one side, and hysterical doubt on the other, with not much in between but hand-waving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's quite possible that the same nostalgia for the dish you served me--completely new to me--that made me try to recreate it also has me funneling the memory of its taste into an ur-coq au vin amalgamated from what little I've read about it. The more I try to taste it through what I have here, the less I realize I remember of it. I remember a feeling, and to put that down would be folly. At the moment of the most precise reconstruction, the memory slips away. Which is what one wants, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The loss is there already, though--reconstruction is not necessary. I won't try to find the same brand of stoneware, paint my dining room the same color, eat at the same time of day. No matter how I try to hold my fork in the same peculiar way you did--with only three fingers and no thumb, as if uncaring that it could slip out of your grasp--I will not divine the moment or you through a fork. For one thing, my hands aren't small enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, what have you been cooking these days?</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/07/coq-au-vin.html' title='Coq au Vin'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6965819310524140296/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/07/coq-au-vin.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6965819310524140296'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6965819310524140296'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/07/coq-au-vin.html' title='Coq au Vin'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QeMdveuGX3A/T_4CVJBVnnI/AAAAAAAAEcI/fWek5pFYkXA/s72-c/IMG_1110.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-5733655426829063126</id><published>2012-07-08T21:33:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.389-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Short Recipes</title><content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;Cover Your Ears&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shuck two dozen ears of corn.

There is no level the same as any other, but neither is there a level much different from any other. Level by level you go down as far as you can into the cave, until you die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's easy to die in this world composed of limited elements lifted from Indiana Jones. There are snakes (you hate those), homocidal Oriental musclemen, rolling balls of stone twice your size released when you steal a golden idol, bats, spiders, animated skeletons, and most lethal of all (because easy to forget), arrow traps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To replenish your life, there are damsels. From the corners of this infinitely rearranged maze, these blondes scream "HELP!" They go limp when you carry them in your arms, and sometimes limper when you throw them into the paths of arrows to disarm traps or at creatures to bludgeon them to death with her body. If dead they are excellent body shields, if alive, they are cashed in for longevity at the maze's exit. She walks through the doorway, and you gain a heart: You can now be hit once more before dying. Where they go is unknown. When you go follow through that same door, you enter another, deeper maze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So long as you live you may acquire money. On the surface this is your only desire. Your greed for gold coins, idols, and gems is as insatiable as it is casual. It is, seemingly, your reason for exploring. You use your ingenuity to access the riches scattered throughout the caves. When you die, none of this capital is preserved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you die, the path you have forged through the cave is not a path at all, because you can't retrace your steps. Nothing you did matters any more. Yet you continue to spelunk, the reborn you. What carries over between your numerous deaths at the bottom of each new but very similar cave? You learn better how to navigate these caves, to go further down into the world that never translates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it becomes a familiar background, you nonetheless attune yourself to the sonic quality of the caves. Unlike the caves themselves, their sound repeats. Each iteration is a perfect reproduction of the previous. What you attune to is the difference when the cave's patience with your presence is running out. Sound slows down, distorts. At first this is not alarming, or even noticable, because the cave's sound is defined by an eery bending of square waves. After the first time you die from a haunting of a cave ghost, the ambiguity turns over: The mundane bending sounds like it might be the end of your days. You develop an anxious ear. The familiar repetition is ever on the brink of an intimation of doom. You begin to really listen.&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://photocortex.blogspot.com/2012/07/spelunky.html' title='Spelunky'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/8725105692042265250/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/07/spelunky.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8725105692042265250'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8725105692042265250'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/07/spelunky.html' title='Spelunky'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-T6U6ahLYJHc/T_fS9xqC4HI/AAAAAAAAEZM/RKywmELEVb4/s72-c/0706122309.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-7734887419388707183</id><published>2012-07-04T12:00:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.427-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Everything I Write is as Over-the-top as Richard Klein's Cigarettes are Sublime</title><content type='html'>&lt;em&gt;Cigarettes are Sublime&lt;/em&gt; has emboldened me in my love of infusions of bitter aromatics in lemonade. I've often wondered why I add rose water or cloves to lemonade when essentially it makes the lemonade taste worse. The smell of roses or cloves may be pleasant (although whether they go with lemon is debatable), but they taste bitter. You may object that bitter is sometimes a good flavor, and I would agree, but I must first posit bitter as essentially an unwanted flavor to explain why it can become desirable. Klien is insistent upon the point that tobacco smoke has never been reputed to taste or even smell good, and that nicotine addiction is insufficient to explain the particular pleasures of smoking or its role in the production of 20th century art. He is insistent on this, he says, because of the pervasive witchhunt on smoking (it's no longer 1993, but this persists). The bitter taste of rose water doesn't carry the same stigma or the same genuine threats of poor health and death. It would be going a bit far to describe all bitter tastes as sublime, but Klein's account of the pleasures of the consumption of unpleasant things suggests an explanation of all the vile things I like or liked: coffee, the overconcentrated tea I used to drink as a teenager, chocolate, lemonade with rose water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being an academic, Klein has to explain, too, the hyperbole of his discussion of cigarettes, and he does so hyperbolically, in the wordplaying convolutions vagueness of someone who has waded deep into post-structuralist prose. There's something absurdly reverent about the way he writes about cigarettes. He paints portraits of modernists smoking to commune with the unrepresentable beyond that modernists reach for. Instead of the philosopher contemplating his chair, Klein gives us Sartre contemplating his cigarette. Cigarettes provide "little terrors in every puff", or an "intimation of mortality." He also terms the "negative pleasure" of smoking "a blockage", and it is in this sense that I enjoy bitter lemonade. On this point it becomes apparent that my pleasure in bitterness is as invested in a beyond as Klein is. Or is it? Is my pleasure in bitter things as simple as that, not because bitterness forces an encounter with a barrier I can't cross, but just because bitterness tastes good to me? Do I simply desire bitterness--something within reach--or do I desire an impossible infinity through bitterness?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I add far too much rose water. More overpowering than the scent is the causticness that lingers in the throat. It slows me; rather than gulping the lemonade, I sip it, savoring and at the same time keeping at bay the flavor. The cominbation of floral and bitter is much like chewing on a lavander spring, another of my habitual negative pleasures. The lavander-chewing dries out my mouth during precisely the hot weather in which I want to be quenched. During the summer, rose lemonade is at once refreshing and dehydrating. It pickles. There's a luxury in drinking something that does not taste entirely wet. I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be keeping myself hydrated, but I'm not doing much about it. Plain lemonade, on the other hand, may be drunk like gatorade. It disappears alarmingly quick; its passage is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's just this lack of blockage that makes this post so malformed. Not needing to write it all now, I keep deferring the difficult parts. I leave threads bare, promising to weave them in later. The whole thing becomes frayed and unfocused because I still think it can be better than it is, eventually. Not accepting the mediocrity it's bound to be, it becomes worse.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/07/everything-i-write-is-as-over-top-as.html' title='Everything I Write is as Over-the-top as Richard Klein&amp;#39;s Cigarettes are Sublime'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/7734887419388707183/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/07/everything-i-write-is-as-over-top-as.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7734887419388707183'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7734887419388707183'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/07/everything-i-write-is-as-over-top-as.html' title='Everything I Write is as Over-the-top as Richard Klein&amp;#39;s Cigarettes are Sublime'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-864358247406072882</id><published>2012-07-01T15:05:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.453-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Giseppi's Pizza</title><content type='html'>To begin with self-referenciality, this blog is beginning to resemble my now defunct autobiographical coffee shop blog, &lt;a href="http://psychocafegraphy.blogspot.com/"&gt;Psychocafegraphy&lt;/a&gt;. I was more distant then, but the mystical, hyperbolic, half-baked wisdom is returning. To write anything at all these days I have to push myself up against gears, grind myself a bit. Not because I love making it difficult (well, okay, maybe), but because it's easiest to mine solipsism for a topic, and because I don't know how to muster the attention for any other kind of writing than the bear-my-soul variety, even if (often) through a layer of metaphor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What emerges in the confessional I've turned this blog into, though, is a sense of having bullshitted. Ursula le Guin's complaint against the written medium is that once you've written it down, you can't change your mind. She was troubled enough by this to publicly disagree with her own novel (&lt;i&gt;The Left Hand of Darkness&lt;/i&gt;), and capitulate to critical interpretation. In autobiographical writing, what's troubling about the written word becomes uncanny--all these ghosts of yourself floating about wily-nilly. It brings me to yelling profanity at myself on a daily basis. But along with the megalomanical shame that comes with putting an intimate picture of myself into permanent language, there is an odd kind of relief. Even though niggling tendrils work their way out of it, the door has been shut on whatever subject I just wrote about. But actually, if I shut the door firmly enough, I find that it's wide open again. Writing Psychocafegraphy, the doors were literal and geographical as well as personal. I was closing off whole areas of the town to myself, revealing my ways of inhabiting each and (eventually) every coffee shop. It didn't matter that almost nobody read what I wrote. The glimpse of myself in the mirror was enough to make me avoid certain places and to multiply my already obsessive self-consciousness. Eventually I just shifted. The coffee shop I vehemently loathed on the blog became the one I frequented most--a new secret to inhabit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bring this up because there's this pizza place. There's nothing about it I like, and the pizza is, well, grody, but I go there habitually. I don't mean I go every day, or even necessarily every month. There's nothing regular about my visits, but they have a certain consistency. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It began with my visits to the University library. That library and the whole end of town that surrounds it have come to signify independence for me. It was on the university campus after all where sanctioned independence was first given to me in the form of Academy, a kind of academic summer camp for the "gifted and talented" (whatever that might mean). I can't remember how long it lasted. It may have only been a week, but for the duration we slept on campus in dorms. I think. I can't remember the dorms either, only vaguely the cafeteria, or merely that there was a cafeteria, that illicit items could be found there such as donuts, and that my friends and I indulged in them accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In high school, before the library was remodeled and it was decked-out in dingy browns and dark, pebbly concrete, I went there with lofty ambitions of soaking up the knowledge that the shelves were stuffed with. For some unknown reason the subject my whims landed on was astrogeology. It was literally and conceptually far off enough. I read about the geology of other planets, understanding hardly a word. It was the sheer reaching I wanted, to be in that position of trying desperately to understand something that vast and impressive, of looking up at it in longing incomprehension--a more or less religious experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unsurprisingly, it was a girl a few years (or two, or one?) older than me who I held in a very similar regard to astrogeology who drew me there. I can't remember exactly how the two of us ended up in the library at the same time. Maybe I accompanied her there, on some errand for a book or to use their computers, or maybe when I went there to research my project on Buckminster Fuller I ran into her. In any case the place became hallowed in connection to her. She had read wider and more earnestly than I, and here was an opportunity to reach toward her. The library had become a shrine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my last year of high school, the library was the place we met to study for our comparitive government AP exam. The university was also where AP Chemistry labs took place, and where the video production class was held. It felt kingly to leave the high school campus. In my precociousness it was like being given another year of age ahead of time. At that time age was something I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to school at that university, too, for a year, during which time the library was being loudly renovated. But it wasn't until I left for Maine and came back with late essays to complete over College of the Atlantic's winter break that I found myself spending so much time at the renovated library, and going to Giseppi's pizza for dinner. I did so out of a desire not to go home just yet, despite being hungry. I found I craved it, the disgustingness of it, the assumption that my brother would disapprove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the summer I stayed out of the house for as long as possible by coming to the university and when I got hungry taking a Giseppis lunch special on a paper plate to the wide lawn next to one of the university dorms. The grease soaked into the plate. The lemonade or iced tea that I always got (a drink comes with the lunch special) was acrid, and the pizza itself was overcooked and sometimes stale. But I loved it, sitting there in the grassy shade of a tree, eating my nasty lunch and reading a book. I always wanted either to take my pizza to the dirty picnic table just out the door under the awning (if raining) or to the field across the street (if warm) because the inside is so abomidable. A cramped space with long bench seating on either side, bright red oilcloth covering the tables. It's filled with a few old arcade games and a teleivision always turned to some variety of sport. The walls are covered with photos of local sports teams, and loyalty to the high school football team, the Grizzleys, is declared loudly by stickers and logos painted on the walls. It is, in short, an utterly alien space for me to sit in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I choose to sit inside, despite the warmth outside, contemplating fading photos of footballers. There is a picture of three teenagers atop a snowy mountain (either Mount Ashland or Mount Shasta), holding up a Giseppi's pizza in a box, showing it to the camera and to Giseppi's--&lt;i&gt;we took your pizza up here!&lt;/i&gt; I wonder how cold and hard the cheese was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people who work at the counter have always intimidated me. I always sound stiff and out of place in the (to me inaccessible) comfort of brusque manners and dingyness. Coming here is for me an exoticism; it's an encounter, just a little frightening. For a timid yuppie in Ashland, this is as close as its gets to the&amp;nbsp;titillation&amp;nbsp;for slumming it.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/07/giseppis-pizza.html' title='Giseppi&amp;#39;s Pizza'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/864358247406072882/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/07/giseppi-pizza.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/864358247406072882'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/864358247406072882'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/07/giseppi-pizza.html' title='Giseppi&amp;#39;s Pizza'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-900926969827745921</id><published>2012-06-26T00:23:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.467-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Ruts</title><content type='html'>When you see relatives infrequently enough, each meeting isn't just catching up, but reacquainting. You don't remember exactly who this vaguely familiar person is, and you don't know how they've changed. They may not. Years put a fog around people, which oddly makes it possible to see them clearly. Getting a first impression anew. You don't necessarily know those you live with, work with, see every day, but you no longer try to. You do; they've calcified to you. The air is particularly clear in San Francisco when the fog clears, the light painfully bright. (Look, I'm romanticizing a place I felt dull towards.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were in a bit more of a sheltered place--Oakland. "You're a good cook, right?" Am I? "I get stuck in ruts." "We all do." Remembering she's fifteen years older, her sociable persona younger. Matured past what she can express breezily to an uncle, an uncle's girlfriend, her father, a cousin. That's the flattering way I'd like to think of my cooking, too: It's evolved away from everything I cooked, to the point of hardly cooking anything. My repertoire diminished to nothing. Nice way to save yourself, but it's not cooking. No growth can happen without trying anything. What's growth but destruction? There's nothing I even want to eventually be rid of. Every dish is gross to imagine. What I do cook just mitigating disgust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there's more than what I can imagine (bake-fried potatoes, sautéed zucchini and tomatoes, roast chicken legs, pizza, eggs and various oiliness, salad, pancakes), but I want newness to appear from nowhere otherwise it's not new. Perusing glossy cookbooks involves gusto and an ability to discern what might tantalize the palette enough to bother making, a talent shrewd shoppers possess, not me. Only writing this gives me the impression I even want to cook anything other than what I do. Otherwise don't mind eating whatever's around, or whatever fumes left of imagination hit when I slump into the supermarket. What's cheap and not too depressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was once one of those recipe-mongers, devoured the Internet of recipes, salivated, filled my head with an ever-shifting list of what I wanted to cook. Recipes are shit, lowest form of culinary communication, do not tell the dish, give no sense of what's involved or what's appealing. Wrote a recipe for a friend two weeks ago. Wish I could show instead, not because I don't trust her or because my roast chicken is so great, but because it's all in the neurotic details, the mothering of it, what makes me irritably shoo away others' hands--they don't understand my baby. I pretend nonchalance in the kitchen to most people, but I'm murderous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I want is for a friend to proselytize to me, to reveal their beloved to me. I'd understand if nobody wanted to though--what they love I may well hate. Or, slowly, to love. It took a relationship with an avocado-lover to get me to like them, and then only really after the relationship ended, after there was no interest (in the derogatory sense of paranoid political philosophy) in liking avocados, eventually finding that a good avocado is something to search for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More often, though, what I cook is defined by what I no longer cook. Thin amnesiac practice of a few dishes supposedly embodying years of learning. It's not me, just some things I cook, honest. What I can't imagine my way out of now. In "Justified", the central character's defining thing is his hat. "Why the hat?" "Honestly? I tried it on and it fit." A lie. The rhetorical recourse to pure practicality or happenstance that's a blushing cop-out. Ego cutting its losses: No, I was not here. I am not here at all. I am somewhere else, expanding to the infinitude of the withheld.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/06/ruts.html' title='Ruts'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/900926969827745921/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/06/ruts.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/900926969827745921'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/900926969827745921'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/06/ruts.html' title='Ruts'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-9136718101762658162</id><published>2012-06-21T17:55:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.472-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>I D E A L</title><content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;I like to remind everyone I meet that swallowing is not natural. A characteristically exasperating conversational habit, especially during meals, which is just when I bring it up. Like saying during coitus that biological imperatives have no intrinsic normative force. Mood breaks when necessity falls away (and with clunky academic diction). When small you can choose not to swallow. You would starve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's preferable to glide over such things. Pleasure in spinning the primal. The centrifical force of the everyday considerable; it's a wonder we aren't always dizzy. A restaurant on the beach in Santa Cruz endeavors to fling its customers into the breakers. With wide-set capitals it declares itself IDEAL. Its menu more specific, the cover a black and white photo of a shapely woman in a bathing suit, holding a tall salmon in each hand, her pose bent at one knee, her eyes smiling (as the photographed must be). My uncle, drawn by the $4.95 breakfast special, says "look at the size of those salmon." Inside the restaurant the gaze is deflected in the same way. Look at the size of those plates (carried by waitresses no older than eighteen in mandatory short shorts). One jump over two messes. Do greasy eggs, potatoes, and bacon go down easier when served by nubiles? That would be IDEAL, crossing its fingers.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/06/i-d-e-l.html' title='I D E A L'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/9136718101762658162/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/06/i-d-e-l.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/9136718101762658162'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/9136718101762658162'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/06/i-d-e-l.html' title='I D E A L'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-1834676347461327089</id><published>2012-06-11T02:23:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T15:39:03.389-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>Disorganized Thoughts on the Consumption of Cinema</title><content type='html'>My brother and I recently purchased Civilization V. What is your moneys worth in such a game, in which there is no single player campaign to mark completion? It's absurd to measure the duration of gaming you get out of Civilzation, because the transaction works the other way around: Civilization is a vessel into which you pour time. It has an incredible capacity, even a kind of suction. Play for eight hours and force yourself to stop, wanting only to continue playing. There's something monstrous about being taken, held, and never released. Isn't the most optimistic point of games to renew our sense of freedom, to be drawn in enough that being ejected feels like a beginning? Nearing the end of a movie, I feel a great excitement for leaving the theater. What I pay for is that exit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's another reason I wanted to play Civilization V, a reason I haven't quite used up yet, even though my brother is understandably fed up with the incredible time commitment a game of Civ requires, and refuses to play any more. (The game is on his computer and won't run on any other in the house.) Still hungering for more Civ, I searched the internet for free alternatives that would run on my dated computer. One of the clones, &lt;a href="http://www.c-evo.org/text.html"&gt;c-evo&lt;/a&gt;, has an ambitious mission statement. They contend that the problem with computer games is that they're not designed to be crystaline like chess, but instead are designed as baubles to be consumed for their novelty value and then discarded out of boredom with an imperfect game. I think they're overestimating the genre's potential, but the observation that computer games are played for their novelty is one I find irrefutable. Why, for instance, play Diablo III? New weapons, new items, new characters, new graphics. The game itself is still as blindingly dull and addictive as before. In fact, I'm not sure games have changed that much since the release of Quake, but novelty has eternally sprung.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And novelty has another draw: Before the game is ever finished, press releases hint at everything that's new and in so doing give it a utopian glint on the horizon. You begin thinking "if I could play it..." Like many other products, you buy them to fix your life. It can almost be better not to buy them at all, to never be disappointed or face reality, and instead to let the wished-for products sprout whole imagined kingdoms of better life. Almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie hype is not new, but its intensity has been able to ramp enormously with the many mediums the Internet has availed. And as updates of older films are made closer and closer to the last iteration's release date, movies are starting to be consumed a lot like video games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new Spider Man movie is made not even a decade after the previous, and we itch for its revitalizing potential. "Prometheus" is essentially "Alien", but with more glitz (both pseudophilosophical and visual). "Avatar" is just a rehash of every James Cameron trope, but with a shiny technology called 3D (yes, I am one of those grumpy old people who think 3D is a lame fad to sell tickets at a higher price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People pay for that moment of hope, the ticket in their hand, the film not yet begun, full of anticipation, and they pay for afterwards, when the film becomes a conversational token. Watching the film gets happily syncopated away, leaving only desire and signification. "The Avengers" is, I hear, a wildly successful film, but does it bubble up into your life? Do you dream of Captain America gripping a trash can lid?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know about you, but I take a perverse pleasure in not being surprised by a film. Walking in with an asernal of reviews to agree and disagree with, steeled with several lines of analysis to keep the film at bay. I may as well; I can't not read about it before going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's funny, I want to see "Prometheus", but the thought of actually sitting through it is unpallatable. This huge gap between the fantasy it promises to deliver and my imagination of how it would actually be to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is to say our relationship to the cinema is essentially lust. Aroused by hype, our desire has nothing to do with spending time with or having ourselves in any way complicated by a movie. We simply have found a fresh locus for hope. We gape and think "if only I could have that, everything would be good again." Its contours become the articulations of our future. And we don't have to give anything to get it, we just have to pay for it. Wow, I've been watching too much "Mad Men".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is us and why is lust bad, again? I'm bad at sustaining a polemic (or even merely a line of thought) because I hardly begin articulating passion before I no longer believe it. It all rings false. A good polemic is neither a liar nor faithful, but simply does not see things as either true or untrue. You can push belief because you've given up. Yup, there's a romanticization of advertising if I ever heard one.</content><link rel='related' href='http://sweatingdark.blogspot.com/2012/06/disorganized-thoughts-on-consumption-of.html' title='Disorganized Thoughts on the Consumption of Cinema'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/1834676347461327089/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/06/disorganized-thoughts-on-consumption-of_1230.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1834676347461327089'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1834676347461327089'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/06/disorganized-thoughts-on-consumption-of_1230.html' title='Disorganized Thoughts on the Consumption of Cinema'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-248204444240214187</id><published>2012-06-06T19:13:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T19:45:43.767-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>(Don't Pretend This Makes Sense)</title><content type='html'>Years ago, undoubtedly following a link from &lt;a href="http://thisrecording.com/today/2011/8/1/in-which-we-finger-plush-towels.html"&gt;anthro girl extraordinaire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://previouslyinaudible.wordpress.com/"&gt;Ashley Olive&lt;/a&gt;, I watched a youtube video of advice on giving yourself (your female self) you-time. You were to go out with yourself (to a restaurant for instance) without your phone. Like in a notice in a movie theater, the girl reaching empowerment in the video turned off her phone. She then sat down with her journal, of course. It's good advice, but significant that (lame phrase to open a line of inquiry) the noblest dreams of those of us who are soaked in digital communication revolve around the absence of cell phones and computers. (Truism.) I fantasize about spaces in which I can focus, where reflection is possible, and time expands from its usual dull rush. That time is something I spend has become all too real of an idiom. We do indeed appear to be living in &lt;a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/features/graphic-interface/"&gt;an economy of attention&lt;/a&gt;, and so the fantasy of escape has become not having to pay attention to anything. The desire is to get to the practice beneath the performance, the being underneath the sign, the experience under the appearance. (Which connects to not paying attention to anything how?) Great nostalgia there. Life "outside" grows large in the imagination; "living in the moment" becomes virtue itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My version of this fantasy would never be complete without gastronomic underpinnings. It is in precisely these predigital conditions that eating can be best appreciated. Solitude is not necessary, but the company must be perfect if there is to be any at all, otherwise the food goes untasted. It's difficult to savor food. Take chocolate. There are two ways of eating it. You can munch it hungrily, swallowing the shards before they fully melt, or you can let it sit in your mouth, releasing rich liquid. ("Releasing rich liquid" isn't even good erotic writing.) Usually I don't have the patience for the latter, and it's pointless to force myself, to mix virtue with pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of my fondest memories of eating take place on the back porch in summer. It's quiet and secluded by tall trees, but with enough of a vista for the mind to wander. Just taking a book or a notebook out there is not enough, though. There must be at the very least tea. It used to be my habit to take a cup of heavily spiced chai, to sweat triply from 90 degree heat, an excess of white pepper and ginger, and hot liquid. Last year it was bread and soft butter ("soft butter?" "yes, &lt;em&gt;soft&lt;/em&gt; butter" could be dialog in a Fry &amp;amp; Laurie sketch), and grilled meat and vegetables. Grilled zucchini with balsamic vinegar and olive oil was a favorite, something I'm sure A.A. Gill would scoff at. Outside, eating takes on a sensuality that can't be found indoors. (In lieu of anything else to say, circularity works.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's nothing revelatory about it, but as long as we mythologize our time away from the information streams of digital gadgetry, let us admit that food is the perfect fetish, that the world blooms from taking apart a piece of cake, and that what I'm really talking about is reading M.F.K. Fisher on the back porch in the shade with slices of pork, a saucer of salted olive oil, and some chunks of bread. (The food doesn't actually sound at all good does it?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's tempting to believe in the utopian potential of removing oneself. Rarely do I think of it as a break--instead I'm always making a full-blown resolution of asceticism. One of Kate Millett's friend-lovers in &lt;i&gt;Flying&lt;/i&gt;, Claire, does little else but read "like nobody has since the nineteenth century" in her cheap apartment. She doesn't just read. She reads in themed binges. One month it's the stars and science fiction, another, philosophy. She styles herself a mystic, and is capable of such flight of idealism. She is at once who I wish I could be (I have always idealized the kind of person whose life is reading) and a sober reflection of that idol (there's something neurotic about trying to remove herself so entirely). She is also, in particular circumstances, someone with whom I identify. She can only handle a crowd briefly and has to flee. She's the one in hiding behind reading material at a party. She toys with asceticism, swearing off "the pleasures of the flesh," probably for different reasons. It's in precisely this wistful spirit of brushing away, though, that my short-lived resolutions are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all falls apart rather easily. As soon as the self-congratulatory thoughts come--"isn't this wonderful? I don't need anything. I feel so relaxed and content, I could stay out here reading all day!"--I itch to check my email, for someone to call me or text me, for something to happen on the Internet.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/06/dont-pretend-this-makes-sense.html' title='(Don&amp;#39;t Pretend This Makes Sense)'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/248204444240214187/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/06/don-pretend-this-makes-sense.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/248204444240214187'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/248204444240214187'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/06/don-pretend-this-makes-sense.html' title='(Don&amp;#39;t Pretend This Makes Sense)'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-7542224613669528694</id><published>2012-06-04T15:55:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:07:45.327-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Pics'/><title type='text'>The Forest in the Garden</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-P18U4agZJDk/T808mMCXvJI/AAAAAAAAEY8/wZniYSn2jLc/s1600/ea2550554169_61d4da15-3d54-47cf-9ebe-06c766584605.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-P18U4agZJDk/T808mMCXvJI/AAAAAAAAEY8/wZniYSn2jLc/s1600/ea2550554169_61d4da15-3d54-47cf-9ebe-06c766584605.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ought to be a whole hierarchy of smaller chairs scattered throughout the bamboo garden, running the gamut from toddler-sized to ant-sized. I've ruined the illusion of scale of course, though I doubt it was very convincing. The chairs don't quite look like the kind you sit in. The irrigation gadget, if you can see it, might give it away, or the size of the lion statue, which may somehow look the size that it is. People worry about including scale references in photos in a technical or scientific context, but there are so many clues that to truly confuse the eye an extraordinary level of control over the scene is necessary. It works best when there's hardly a scene at all. The bamboo, conrete patio "stones," chairs, lion statue, soil, cement wall, fallen leaves, and irrigation lines provide a thicket of contextualizing scale data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely speak in that kind of "ought," don't generally look at something and imagine the way I wish it were. I'm not a visionary. One needs visionaries, but they can be exasperating company, never stopping to see or accept anything, always moving themselves into the scene to fix it. A visionary rejects knowledge. My silly little dream of what I want this cafe patio to be replaces what inspired it, the two undersized chairs. Of course, dreams of what could be are hardly the only things to swoop in to mediate experience. It's not that the visionary gives up the object (whatever that is) but gives up thinking, delays it. He is constantly dreaming up ways to improve the world and persuing those ways, so that he need never arrive. The thinker, on the other hand, is constantly keeping action at bay through contemplation, adjusting his understanding of the world to it. The world will happily never meet the visionary's expectations, and the thinker's understanding will happily never meet the world. Both are deeply entrenched. Neither ever reach anything because their criteria are broken, but then if they did reach something, then what? There would be nothing left to do or understand whatever the hell I'm going on about.</content><link rel='related' href='http://photocortex.blogspot.com/2012/06/forest-in-garden.html' title='The Forest in the Garden'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/7542224613669528694/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/06/the-forest-in-garden.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7542224613669528694'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7542224613669528694'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/06/the-forest-in-garden.html' title='The Forest in the Garden'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-P18U4agZJDk/T808mMCXvJI/AAAAAAAAEY8/wZniYSn2jLc/s72-c/ea2550554169_61d4da15-3d54-47cf-9ebe-06c766584605.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-3341629146066787164</id><published>2012-05-26T01:21:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T19:45:43.774-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Miso Gravy, or Dramatic Short Sentences</title><content type='html'>You know what the worst food in the world is? Food trying desperately to be other food. Servility isn't a good taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basket case of slavering self-erasure I have in mind is, of course, vegetarian food trying to be carnivorous. Specifically, vegetarian gravy. No, not gravy in the sense of hearty sauce, but actually the juices extracted from parts of dead animals. The brown stuff you pour over mashed potatoes. A certain excitement pervades those vegetarians who feel they have conjured meatiness. The pride with which this recipe was related to me, the ecstasy its consumption reportedly gave. It's recipe that can only be described as brute-force cookery. (Brute-force in the sense of hacking, wherein a massive number of passwords are sent to the target, until one of them, hopefully, turns out to be the right one. The problem in this case is that the sheer volume of data constitutes a denial-of-service attack in the mouth.) Here are the ingredients: garlic, onions, nutritional yeast, mushrooms, miso, vegetable bouillon, and white wine. Basically every possible non-dairy source of umami mixed together in a pot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might love the stuff on popcorn, but nutritional yeast is particularly offensive. I shiver (for several reasons) at the memory of the dinner pap I cooked up on the week-long solo segment of my bicycle trip back from the coast some years ago. I brought with me tons of tiny macaroni elbows, a kind of hippie instant pasta (I brought it in the bulk section of the local co-op). This I would boil in a tiny pot over a tiny stove just outside of or sometimes inside my tent, damning what I'd heard was a risk of carbon monoxide poisoning, because it was raining. Once cooked, I poured out most of the water, dropped a pat of butter on top of it, some salt, a pinch of an all-purpose spice mixture I had concocted for the trip, and a mountain of nutritional yeast. This was supposed to be protein. For the same reason I would sometimes chop cheese into it, too. It was wonderful, but then everything is when you've pedaled yourself to exhaustion the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is, at the time, it wasn't just calories to assuage my gullet and cramping legs, it was decadence. I had hoarded these ingredients. The first half of the bicycle trip was with company from whom I hid such naughty items as pasta. "Company" isn't quite right--I wouldn't want to give the impression I was going on this trip anyway and these two guys wanted to tag along. I was one of the tag-alongs, and tag-alongs are never really in the company of others. It's just out of reach. I spent the month before we left agonizing over whether to go or not. It was crazy, I wasn't ready for the physical exertion or the socializing, my bike was in a state of disrepair. In the end, though, there was no use fighting it. He was irresistible. He knew everything, like which dumpsters were good, where the best abandoned fruit trees were, and that women's legs were just as hairy as men's. In the house where in the yard he currently had an arrangement to live, there was a photo of someone with his or her back to the camera, and I made some remark about "him". He laughed that laugh of his, the one I still steal, with the multiple joyous gasps for air at the end of it, and said "yeah, because a woman could never have legs that hairy." He was in good humor, but still I stammered, making some attempt at a defense, though perhaps that memory was only esprit de l'escalier. I can't remember if my face did, but I certainly burned with shame. That after all is the best glue, and I felt it just being in his presence. He knew how to live; I was just a pathetic bourgeois impostor. I had to go with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it was he who determined what could be said and could not, what should be done and should not. For the trip he was the horizon, above which was reality, and below, the underworld. Without him just a jumble, no crust of potential happiness, and no heat and pressure below. Not that he wanted to determine anything. He was one of those people who tries draw others out, like pupils. And surely it was lonely, looking into our eyes and finding only a wall of subservience. If there was any resistance it was ultimately rescinded, tucked away. What to do instead?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He had a passion for water. Thus the coast, I suppose. The easiest way to the coast is to follow a river. The highway along the river is dangerous, more so for bicycles. Winding steeply down, on one side cliff, one side sheer drop to the water, precariously held by an intermittent guardrail. There's no shoulder, only a white line where we tried to place our wheels, the cars squeezing past us at fifty miles an hour. Caution was not possible; safety meant not hesitating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes his passion for the water would take him (and us) where there was a convenient ramp to the river. His passion was infectious and the immune system could not quite identify it. He was impulsive, open, exuberant. We his companions were both pensive, quiet, found it difficult to jump. (Though it was less of a jump, I think, for the other one of us.) He jumped. He whooped. I stood with my shirt off, crumpled inward, staring at the ice-blue water rushing. While I thought the water roared. I could enter but I wouldn't. The water would chill me, and it did. I was in the water but I wasn't. I smiled. It was an action. I looked at him smiling, drying off, and I was envious. To me water was just water, to him, something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with food. I always wanted more quantity. I wanted to gorge myself. One of my happiest moments on the trip was when he suggested we all get ice cream from a gas station. I say suggested; to us it meant we were allowed. Ice cream was an indulgence. I devoured mine looking at my bike saddle, exhaustion at the prospect of again mounting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the fact that he willingly was going to bicycle from Oregon to Alaska doesn't tell you, I'll tell you that he had a passion for punishment. We reached the mouth of the river. The land flattened. The road eased and quieted. He stopped. There was a patch of stinging nettles on the roadside. On his birthday he had run through a gauntlet of friends spanking him with brushes of stinging nettles. Standing in the nettle patch, gathering them for a meal, I discovered there is something undeniably tantalizing about them. In my shorts I daintily avoided their leaves, but I was drawn deeper and deeper into where they couldn't be avoided. I wanted to trick myself into being stung. Their threat a ticklish promise. He barreled into the thick of them, grabbing handfuls. I was disgusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night we boiled the nettles in seawater. It's the only time I've ever eaten them, and I remember them as delicious. I wanted more, but that was the whole of dinner. The nettles were supposed to sustain us. He wanted to live his dream of gathering the food he ate. He did. I tried. My hunger bubbled up against the diaphragm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was with a mixture of fright and pleasurable anticipation that the third of us left. It was just him and I for the next few days, until we too parted. I had him all to myself, but then I lacked a buffer to hide behind. My anger and longing became more apparent. Glaring at him pedaling ahead of me with ease. Intimate talk was suddenly, frighteningly, possible. As we rode I would tell him things, and sometimes it seemed like he was lifting things out of me like a pickpocket, but they were things I wanted to let go. When I had released them, though, they were wrong. What could I do about the false things I had given him? Correction or silence? The latter only held so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night we shared a tent. I had my own, but I didn't like what using it said. Then I wondered if he wondered why I didn't use mine. Enclosed on both sides. I remember his smile in the mornings, ever jovial. Such warmth there. I hate sleeping with others. Every sound I make redoubles in my imagination of their ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleeping alone is just as bad, in another way. When I began my trip home, I was elated. I was free and I could do whatever I liked. But nobody knew what I was doing. Miles and miles of the prison of the freedom of my mind. Talking to myself. When night fell there was nothing for my thoughts to bump up against, no other mind to speculate. I could eat all the macaroni-and-yeast I liked, filling my belly to sickness. I did have a book. One can only read oneself out of oneself so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the shadow of a carnivorous cuisine, vegetarian has the same options: futile mimicry with an undercurrent of frustration, or empty, desperate freedom. The only way out is to find different company. The straining hurts and hurts to witness. Vegetarian gravy is this strain liquefied. It has the flavor of aspirational pain.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/05/miso-gravy-or-dramatic-short-sentences.html' title='Miso Gravy, or Dramatic Short Sentences'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/3341629146066787164/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/05/miso-gravy-or-dramatic-short-sentences.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3341629146066787164'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3341629146066787164'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/05/miso-gravy-or-dramatic-short-sentences.html' title='Miso Gravy, or Dramatic Short Sentences'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-2783039983793468024</id><published>2012-05-15T02:38:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T19:45:43.771-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>More Efficient than Essays</title><content type='html'>Barbecue&amp;nbsp;Sauce&lt;br /&gt;That obnoxious loudmouth without whom the party is not a party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coffee&lt;br /&gt;The giddiness of infatuation, the sickness of rejection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bacon&lt;br /&gt;Thermonuclear war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chocolate&lt;br /&gt;Monks pretend not to sneer at those who indulge, who just can't handle 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol&lt;br /&gt;And we look down on glue-sniffing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Butter&lt;br /&gt;What was enough yesterday is stingy today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salt&lt;br /&gt;Piety, ignorance, and health are no excuses for bad taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sugar&lt;br /&gt;Some think pleasure will land them in hell, and some think they can feel hell burning up into them, into their teeth--what flattery is that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;I knew a man who grew obesce from eating spoons and spoons of canned frosting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wheat&lt;br /&gt;We all need someone to hallow and to rage against.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose Water&lt;br /&gt;What about the taste of smell?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swiss Cheese&lt;br /&gt;You might not want to shake hands with me because I pick the stuff between my toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turnip&lt;br /&gt;You know those grimacing people to whom others only speak out of a sense of duty, guilt, or pity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Canned Bread&lt;br /&gt;When I asked him if we as a country would ever get over the second world war, he said "I hope not!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cucumber&lt;br /&gt;No outward signs of bitterness;

Lily went to great lengths to transport them from the upper east side to Brooklyn, and there they are, piled on a platter, perfectly browned. I have never seen anyone bite into one. Every episode morning breaks with a Protestant chirp, bracing helicopter shots of the sun rising over Manhattan, and a table set to the brim with inert Continental breakfast foods. Orange juice, coffee, pastries, fruit, yogurt. As you would expect from someone like me, I find the pastries maddening. They look so good, and they're not eaten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not sure about the others, but Chuck and Serena have signiture gastronomic props. One might even call them familiars. Chuck can reliably be seen draining tumblers of brown liquor in his hotel room. It seems he runs on the stuff. Perhaps his peculiar way of moving can be ascribed to the lubrication of his hydraulic limbs. Without whiskey he might--who knows?--become Nate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Berries, it appears, are Serena's substance. They are somehow both a diet and a comfort food. While others consume theoretical croissants, Serena breakfasts on mixed berries. When she pulls off a scheme (don't worry, it will fail by the end of the episode) by posting as Gossip Girl, she is luxuriating in bed, feasting on berries, smirking. Finally, when her life has run dry, her fantasies evaporated, and her imagination halted (which by the way never happens to people in this show--there is always a new angle), Dorota asks her "why you eat berries in dark?"&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/05/berries-in-dark.html' title='Berries in the Dark'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/8298579305178112153/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/05/berries-in-dark.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8298579305178112153'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8298579305178112153'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/05/berries-in-dark.html' title='Berries in the Dark'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-5192380183529927091</id><published>2012-05-08T22:55:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T15:39:03.436-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>The Avengers</title><content type='html'>There are two scenes I remember from "The Avengers", and that's because I was trying to for the purpose of this blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aliens are in the process of blowing up&amp;nbsp;Manhattan. Captain America, in his regalia, jumps on top of a car and begins giving rapid-fire orders to two policemen. They look at him, a little perplexed (and why not, there's a man literally covered in stars and stripes--perhaps he is some sort of street performer). "Why should we take orders from you?" one asks. A few invading aliens are then upon Mr. America, and he dispatches them quickly with a flourish. The fight ends with him holding one of their severed cocks. I mean guns. Without another word, the policemen immediately get on the radio to relay his orders. Might makes right. The audience laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of those in the way of salvation are a bit more prickly. Namely, the villain, a sickly-pale Tom Hiddleston. When the Hulk threatens him with smash, Loki has a hissy fit. The Hulk may be the "monster," but it's Loki who is feminized, who will lose because he "lacks conviction." Joss Whedon milks the moment for slapstick comedy. Loki stands there ranting that he's a god, and won't be pushed around by puny green creatures. But he gets what's coming to him. Watch the Hulk swatting him repeatedly into the ground like a cat breaking a mouse's neck. Force is so hilarious. The audience is in stitches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They howl, they cheer, they clap at the end. It's like being at a party--loud, offensive, and full of the grotesque squeals of public pleasure. It's my worst nightmare, except, thankfully, I am not expected to participate. And the movie, well, what is it but dancing? Bloody, brutal, noisy dancing. Bumping and grinding escalated to coreographed hate sex. Which by the way is apparently &lt;a href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=336"&gt;all Whedon can imagine&lt;/a&gt; when faced with a female super hero. Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson in skin-tight black) has "too much red on her record." When asked "what did he [Loki] do to you?" (there's a leading question if I ever heard one), she says that she has been "compromised" and must make up for it. Her whole strategy as a spy hinges on manipulating people with her vulnerability. Original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found myself wondering at the perversity of me paying to watch this, something I didn't even want to enjoy. (Though I had hoped that it would be more of a distraction than it was.) There must be something sick about paying eleven dollars to stew in my own loathing and alienation--precisely what I wanted to do. What I didn't bargain for was a headache. I had never seen a movie in 3D before, and now I want never to do so again. The image has a niggling, pixelated, out-of-focus quality even with the glasses on. And for what? So that the film can look like a diorama? It's not a breathtaking addition of another&amp;nbsp;dimension, but a transformation into cardboard cutouts. It's also a distancing irritant. Rather than immersed, I kept having to ask myself "what am I looking at?" Then again, this is not a film from which I should expect immersion.</content><link rel='related' href='http://sweatingdark.blogspot.com/2012/05/avengers.html' title='The Avengers'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/5192380183529927091/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/05/the-avengers_7473.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/5192380183529927091'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/5192380183529927091'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/05/the-avengers_7473.html' title='The Avengers'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-1411996322974057177</id><published>2012-05-06T17:54:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:07:45.319-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Pics'/><title type='text'>The Hotel</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XHdDJPEQUGQ/T6cbScZbsPI/AAAAAAAAEWk/Ml4n547g-y0/s1600/0506121226.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XHdDJPEQUGQ/T6cbScZbsPI/AAAAAAAAEWk/Ml4n547g-y0/s1600/0506121226.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to take the elevator up to the top floor, but the last time I did one of the hotel staff finally did something about it. He was very apologetic. His first sentence began with a conciliatory "I know". I don't remember what else he said. That he can't have non-guests up here, probably. Which led us into the elevator together, trying to make small talk. He kept apologizing, and I kept saying I didn't hold it against him, or mind much. Every time I go up I know I'm not supposed to be there. That's why I go. The view is wonderfully removed from the street. It is relaxing, or I think so until I'm up there, fidgeting. If it weren't illicit, I doubt I would go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven't been since that run-in with him happened. Maybe there's a camera, or one of the guests was particularly uppity and told him. Or maybe he just noticed me, clearly out of place, entering the elevator. Anyway, I no longer want to take the risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The southern side of the building is very warm, when the sun is out. That side is perpendicular to the main drag, and my route to the grocery store goes along there. It's a half-block of quiet heat. The whole building is painted a very bright beige, which looks yellow at some times of the day. The rest of the time it looks awful. Brutal. Without discrimination--as if every detail has been ignored. The sunlight reflects off of this nearly white surface, creating a kind of solar oven near where it intersects with the sidewalk. If the wind is coming from the north, the massive edifice blocks it. In spring I can here receive an early summer. Then I get to the corner of both the building and the street, and everything floods back: wind, traffic, tourists, cold.</content><link rel='related' href='http://photocortex.blogspot.com/2012/05/hotel.html' title='The Hotel'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/1411996322974057177/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/05/the-hotel.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1411996322974057177'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1411996322974057177'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/05/the-hotel.html' title='The Hotel'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XHdDJPEQUGQ/T6cbScZbsPI/AAAAAAAAEWk/Ml4n547g-y0/s72-c/0506121226.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-1446690889087671502</id><published>2012-05-05T23:01:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:05:49.189-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Drinkable</title><content type='html'>What, other brands of beer have giardia?</content><link rel='related' href='http://photocortex.blogspot.com/' title='Drinkable'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1446690889087671502'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1446690889087671502'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.importType' value='IMPORTED_DRAFT'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-6177697001311690011</id><published>2012-05-05T23:01:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:05:49.184-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Flowers</title><content type='html'></content><link rel='related' href='http://photocortex.blogspot.com/' title='Flowers'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6177697001311690011'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6177697001311690011'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.importType' value='IMPORTED_DRAFT'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8207451340272430444</id><published>2012-05-01T21:45:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T15:39:03.449-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>The Deep Blue Sea</title><content type='html'>The walls are thin in the &lt;a href="http://www.mrmovietimes.com/movie-theaters/varsity-theatre-ashland.html"&gt;The Varsity&lt;/a&gt; and invariably I'm not in the loudest film there. If I were, the booms, crashes, and thuds of Shit Happening in my own theater would drown out the negligable voices and music of the adjacent. But I was watching a matinee of "The Deep Blue Sea", so instead subwoofers bled through the walls in a kind of sinister growl. The resulting soundscape wasn't unfitting. For at least the first quarter of the film I had no idea the foreboding rumblings were from another theater. I marvelled at the use of horror conventions in a period melodrama. Actually even without the extra sound effects, there's still a bit of that. It's put together in a way both thoroughly manipulative and modernist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a noisy film, too, in its way: It begins with an orchestral piece so embarrassingly loud that the images on the screen are overpowered. There's something ugly, tactless about such dramatic music continuing to play. It's like someone yelling to himself in the corner of a room--everyone fidgets awkwardly, pretending not to notice. I think "oh god, what have I gone in for?" Face burning, I wonder if the whole film will play out in this tiresome "The Tree Of Life" mode: epic music trying to inject deep signifigance into short scenes of banality. Then something surprised me. I don't remember what, but the brutality of the sequence was replaced by intrigue. The music fades with Rachel Weisz and Tom Hiddleston interlocked, nude bodies spinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone I know avoided seeing it because it looked scary, and she's not wrong. The trailer, however, makes the film look like a belaboured, anachronistic shriek about adultery, which turns out not at all to be the fulcrum of its thrills. On IMDb the plot is summarized thus: "The wife of a British Judge is caught in a self-destructive love affair with a Royal Air Force pilot." "Caught" is misleading. She isn't trying to hide her affair in the first place. After bitching out her husband's mother at tea, she nonchalantly goes up to the bedroom and phones her lover. What really grabs me is the rash unpredictability of Rachel Weisz in this role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use the title as a metaphor, Weisz as Hester is a slippery fish. It's some time before she ever speaks. In the memories that float up to us--their balast released by her suicide attempt--it's never she who speaks, it's whichever man she's looking at. Either her husband or her lover. I scrutinize her face, looking for a sure sign written there. Which I think is, in a way, to become her. When someone in her building wakes her up from her gas-induced suicidal slumber, she remains abstracted, self-posessed, looking intently for her cigarettes while a woman acquaintance solicits her emotional state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Are you sure you're alright?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Yes I'm fine, just feeling a bit dopey," her expression full of everything else. She lights her cigarette, and smoking it becomes the present to which we return from her reminisces. She leans back onto the couch, takes a drag, and the camera follows the smoke swirling away from her into the dark room. This is exactly like the memories feel--drifting slowly into form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While she broods around her apartment, the orchestral score comes up again. Like her initial voicelessness, omission is used to great effect. Her lover, Freddie, comes in, and the shock is triple: The affair she was remembering is still going on, she's living with him, and he turns the radio from the melancholy score to "something livelier." How to revitalize a script from 1955? Make it a psychological thriller. Who and where is Hester? Even as voices explode, the film keeps a tense distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hester holds very little back from her husband's mother. Over dinner and tea the next day the two have a barely veiled argument about attachment. The mother favors "a guarded enthusiasm" and advises Hester to "beware of passion, it always leads to something ugly." Hester could not be more disgusted by this worldview. A life of strict control and practicality to her is unbearable to imagine. So she boldly dives head-first into Eros, but then what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something to the historical connotations of this love plot. For the boastful soldier home from the war won she has passion, but absolutely no connection. (At the suggestion that "there is more to love than physicality" she instantly rebuts "for me there isn't.") Her old judge of a husband, her connection to the prewar past, to wealth and culture, she rejects. Nothing but the brutally erotic relationship she has with Freddie will do. The kind of cold consistency of heart her husband's mother classically prescribes is too late, no longer responsive to the world that has spring up since she married.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then under this film's cold gaze her oaths of passion for Freddie don't ring true either. The contradictions of her passion are thrown into a harsh light. Utterances echo in a queer glass chamber. To her husband she declares that Freddie is "my whole world." He rules her emotions (which he "didn't ask for," to him becoming her will to power over him), but the specificity of him is nothing to her. His ignorance about art is an annoyance, especially as his insolance about the pointlessness of art doesn't allow her to believe she's getting through to him. When he comes in after her experiment with using the gas for something other than fire, she's looking out the window, smoking. He enthusiastically tells her about his golf game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Are you aware you haven't looked at me this whole time?" he asks jovially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I know what you look like, Freddie."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cause of her suicide is always presumed and never confirmed. Before he finds out she tried to kill herself, Freddie assumes she's angry at him because he forgot her birthday. It's unclear whether she cares at all or if she's just using this as a plausible reason for her mood. When he does find her suicide note, he assumes it's all because of him, for which he rages at her. On this subject she pleadingly yells back "I wasn't blaming you!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her husband, too, assumes that her relationship with Freddie drove her to suicide, and advises her, as you would expect, to get out of it (and to come back to him, of course). She tells him it wasn't that, which he ignores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hester and her suicide are, in other words, empty signifiers. Well, not &lt;i&gt;are--&lt;/i&gt;I'm just too willing to see her in that tired way. I've fallen in love with her mystique, distrusted every word and every gesture. Even if she said why she wanted to die, it would be to someone. There would be an audience and therefore an agenda. I wouldn't believe it. Ugh.</content><link rel='related' href='http://sweatingdark.blogspot.com/2012/05/deep-blue-sea.html' title='The Deep Blue Sea'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/8207451340272430444/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/05/the-deep-blue-sea_6985.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8207451340272430444'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8207451340272430444'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/05/the-deep-blue-sea_6985.html' title='The Deep Blue Sea'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-2544715421478701619</id><published>2012-04-27T10:15:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T19:45:43.768-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Stawberry Shortcake</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XhQwXQOWBEw/T5kMiXh0DBI/AAAAAAAAEWU/B-_mPebElQs/s1600/0419122025.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XhQwXQOWBEw/T5kMiXh0DBI/AAAAAAAAEWU/B-_mPebElQs/s320/0419122025.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;During that time that I reference all too often, the winter break in Bar Harbor I spent alone, I was obsessed with strawberry shortcake. It's one among many foods that I have fetishized, fussed with, and found lacking. I always had to add something to strawberry shortcake. Nutmeg wove its way sucessively through each piece of it: the biscuits, the whipped cream, even, oddly, the sugared strawberries. I put rose water in there, one time. Vanilla in the cream, another. I may even have tried cinnamon somewhere. I did not try any sort of booze, which probably would have been the only thing worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t remember exactly how many times I made strawberry shortcake, but sometimes it seems that all I did during those three weeks was eat strawberry shortcake with cheap Chardonnay and watch “Absolutely Fabulous”. I kept hoping it would be more decadent and less sickeningly rich. The strawberries deceive me into thinking that I’m eating something light and fruity, not a pile of butter and cream. Of course, that is the point of the dish–that the wet, fresh, mildly sweet berries compliment the heavy, dry biscuits and the rich cream. I kept thinking well, it’s almost perfect. Part of the trouble was that by the time I actually took a bite of the stuff, I had already eaten a few biscuits. And having had just eaten dinner, my digestion was already weighed down. The shortcake was putting me to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decadence is by definition excessive, but one wants it to be, somehow, a needful excess. A lush does not wish to drown in pointlessness, to have everything and anything. He wants to get that particular thing, to stretch out fulfillment like taffy. To be decadent is to delay endings, which, really, is to delay time’s passage entirely. Unfortunately, strawberry shortcake leaves you sedated, gurgling, and not freed in the slightest. The worst part is, after one deadening plate, I still want more of it. And I’ll make it again. Decadence may be impossible, but I can try again and again, creating the appearance of decadence. I can try to create a tiny opening of the present, but each attempt takes me further away. Strawberry shortcake, I’m sure you’ll be shocked to know, is not transcendance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That doesn’t stop me from wishing. The only excuse I need is a new angle. This time it was an impetus thinly veiled behind the scent and flavor of strawberries. Someone told me she was eating strawberries, that the flavor was unparalleled, that nohing beats the taste of a good, fresh strawberry. I could never have what I imagined her experience to be, but I could sidle up as close as possible to that red, sylvan jouissance. I immediately bounded to the store, of course, and found that strawberries were on sale. Thrilled, I told her that I got them, that the package of strawberries was in my hand. “Smell them,” she told me. I did. “Oh yes,” I said, the air through the vents of the plastic box perfumed with promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strawberries, through, unless they’re ridiculously good, are improved by sugar and stewing. These strawberries were not quite ripe enough to be best alone. This time strawberry shortcake would be foremost a vehicle for strawberries. I wanted to distill them to purer version of themselves. There would be no distractions: no nutmeg, no rosewater, no vanilla. Just sugar, biscuits, and cream. In the end, same story: nausea, second helpings, remainders of desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;Slice some strawberries, remove their green tops, and put them in a bowl. Cover them with about a tablespoon of sugar for every two strawberries. Stir them about. Set the oven to 425 F. In another bowl mix together two cups flour, three teaspoons baking powder, and two pinches of salt. Put in a stick of cold butter. Coat it with flour and slice it into chunks, then cut it finely into the flour using a pastry cutter. Add one egg and nearly 2/3 a cup of milk. Mix with a fork until a dough is formed. Roll out the dough, dusting it with flour so it doesn't stick. Fold it once onto itself. Roll it out again to roughly 1/3 inch. Cut out small discs with a cup and put them onto a baking pan. Bake until risen and lightly browned on bottom. In yet another bowl whip some heavy cream to very soft peaks. Warm the strawberries in a small pot until all the sugar dissolves. Cut one of the biscuits in half, putting the insides up on a plate.

If years were seconds, it would've been studied by particle physicists. It was there and it was not. Even now, it isn't quite not there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its trouble may have been that it was too easy a target, symbolically. Lincoln is old enough that for many high school students he falls into the category of "old white guys in history textbooks". The statue was nothing but a banal symbol of the authority of adults. Thus for certain teenagers it was the perfect material with which to articulate their aspirational difference from The Man. The statue's destruction was, in other words, a prank. Lighten up, man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First came off its head. Or should I say his? There was something of an uncanny valley about this thing. It was a replica of the Lincoln Memorial, but rather than towering, superhuman, above us, it was slightly smaller than life-size. Like an inverse chicken, it went on being motionless with its head chopped off. I thought it was funny at the time. Precisely the attitude that, fortified with alcohol and testosterone, probably lead to dear Stumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More amusing still (for the same juvenile reasons) was the impotence of authorities' response. He lost his head, so a new one was put on. It was undignified, really--you could tell he wasn't all there because his head was of a different color than the rest of him. He was all white marble, but his head was whiter. This act was repeated, and then repeated again, like a grotesque game of musical heads. This may have gone on for a whole year. I have no idea where all the heads came from, or, indeed, where they all ended up. Sitting in someone's basement, perhaps, is a pile of polished Lincoln heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At some point whoever was in charge of poor Abraham gave up. That, or the pranksters escalated their theft. The whole statue disappeared. Nothing has changed since then. The boulder has not been removed; the statue has not been replaced. At the top of the rock a decayed square of white statue remains is still bolted in place. Now a decade since, it was never smoothed off. Stubbornly, the wound was left. I can't help but think there's something petulant about this: the city wearing the statue's absence on their sleeve.</content><link rel='related' href='http://photocortex.blogspot.com/2012/04/abes-old-haunt.html' title='Abe&amp;#39;s Haunting'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/8451265808780871722/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/04/abe-haunting.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8451265808780871722'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8451265808780871722'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/04/abe-haunting.html' title='Abe&amp;#39;s Haunting'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qYHmeTOamF4/T43-7eV5CvI/AAAAAAAAEVs/HJ5w9aaXNG0/s72-c/0417121321.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4206945082154317989</id><published>2012-04-16T20:56:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:07:45.321-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Pics'/><title type='text'>Wall</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RqGQovG7Xpg/T4opA38qunI/AAAAAAAAEUE/sE1XRUS4nIE/s1600/0414121830.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RqGQovG7Xpg/T4opA38qunI/AAAAAAAAEUE/sE1XRUS4nIE/s1600/0414121830.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around here old houses were built sometime in the 20th century. It’s a big deal. Whole ‘historic districts’ have been&amp;nbsp;demarcated&amp;nbsp;with little signs on top of the street signs like the ‘scenic road’ signs on the highway. The landlord of a house I looked at recently pointed out all the little things she had done to keep the house’s appearance ‘period,’ which in this case was the 1930s. She had torn up the linoleum floors and scraped off the white paint to reveal the wood planks underneath. The house had to be excavated from underneath what these days is midcentury detritus. As far as houses are concerned, the 1930s are more hip than the 1960s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our house, in this older-is-better logic, suffers under more recent fashion atrocities. It was built in 1908, and when my parents moved in, in the 1970s, there was a wraparound porch, and a large central wood stove. The more recent additions, back then, were the thick brown carpets, the hallway that connected the main house to a smaller cottage, and several electric heaters mounted around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the winter I remember living from heater to heater. Whatever we were doing it was always next to the stove or a heater.&amp;nbsp;The stove gave me two childhood fascinations:  the stove was all cast iron, so it was possible to place a cylindrical magnet on the side and watch it roll all the way down without leaving the stove’s surface. When the stove was hot, spit became mesmerizing. One droplet from my lips would sizzle violently and move itself at random across the stove’s flat surface, disappearing after a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are tinged with nostalgia because at some point in my childhood my parents decided to remodel. They had fallen into a&amp;nbsp;sizable&amp;nbsp;chunk of cash, and apparently had been building up fantasies of what the house could be. The porch--where once my brother and I had run around in Superman costumes getting splinters in our feet--moved inside. The living room, as a result, became enormous, and was lined with huge windows. The brown carpets and smallish windows had made the house dark, and now it was seething with sunlight. The carpets were taken away, and pale wood floors were installed. The basement was turned into living space, the awkwardest that ever was: a bedroom without a door, attached to an office. If we’re stuck with positive adjectives, our house had gone from cozy to spacious. If on the other hand we’ve only negative, then from cramped and dark to empty and blinding. We still like to say that it was built in 1908.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This house has gone the opposite route, for far more expense. Instead of&amp;nbsp;remodeled&amp;nbsp;it has been restored. It received the most elaborate paint job in town a few years ago. It’s eye-popping and ostentatious in easter-egg shades of purple, aqua, and gold. Behind a black iron fence it looks to be an untouchable, pristine relic. I have never seen anyone enter or exit it. This could be because the entrance is an alley away from prying eyes. Public and private has been defined rigidly here: Two sides of the house are to be seen, two are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year that paradigm has been finalized. The most solidly build privacy fence I’ve ever seen has been constructed on the private side. It’s made of thick, well-stained wood and iron slats. The alley along which it is built is one I walk several times a week (it’s my route to the library). When it was being built I saw the trench in which it is now anchored. It was three feet deep. This fence is more like a wall, and it isn’t going anywhere.</content><link rel='related' href='http://photocortex.blogspot.com/2012/04/wall.html' title='Wall'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/4206945082154317989/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/04/wall.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4206945082154317989'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4206945082154317989'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/04/wall.html' title='Wall'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RqGQovG7Xpg/T4opA38qunI/AAAAAAAAEUE/sE1XRUS4nIE/s72-c/0414121830.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-3313378729868810496</id><published>2012-04-13T15:37:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T19:45:43.773-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Springs Eternal</title><content type='html'>The first thing I reach for is the tea kettle, and at least half the time, no matter how I brew it or what I do with it, tea is insipid. It’s not enough. Not only does it leave me falling back asleep an hour after waking, but it fails to deliver its promise. The truth of it plunges me from the thin plane of possibility back into reality: It’s noon, and all I have is a mug of lukewarm brown liquid. I ask a lot of it. Not only is it supposed to wrest me from unconsciousness, but it also has to somehow allow me outside my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore sometimes I escalate to coffee, and suddenly there is an arms race of morning aspirational imbibations. Coffee, though, has its problems: burning at the back of the throat, diarrhea, heartburn, sickly taste that cannot truly be scrubbed out of anything. And as much as I need coffee, it can &lt;a href="http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/02/passion-of-coffee.html"&gt;leave me so agitated&lt;/a&gt; that everything becomes nearly impossible, even behaving civilly. Every time I switch to coffee I switch right back to tea the next day. (This is the kind of thing that passes for excitement for me.) It’s not really an escalation or an arms race, and coffee is not superior to or more than tea (except technically in caffeine content, which in the end is irrelevant). What I’m actually doing by switching back and forth is searching for novelty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To this end I also mix up tea preparations. I boil it in milk with ginger, brew nicer leaves, add sugar or do not. I can fiddle all I want, in the end its futile. Novelty comes only out of the blue, and rarely because I decided to drink something different that morning. It grabs me unexpectedly on mornings when I’ve resigned myself to the same damned thing, and suddenly the same tastes different. It’s hotter, fresher, more precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On such lucky mornings I sometimes convince myself that the perfection of the tea (or coffee) can be chocked up to some subtlety in the way I prepared it. I try to replicate it the next day, and it comes out the same old garbage. Too this, too that, a drink to be waded through, not greedily consumed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faced with the pointlessness of tea and coffee, some would give it up entirely, become like monks. These people are just as afraid of intractability as I am. To opt out of the idea of stimulating beverages would take so much maintenance. Maintaining control over the desire surely means being ruled by it. Who manages it completely, anyway? Sounds just as much a longing as what I have for the supposed powers of caffeine. Besides, I could not possibly give up my crutch. This is not something that should ever be uttered at an AA meeting.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/04/springs-eternal.html' title='Springs Eternal'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/3313378729868810496/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/04/springs-eternal.html#comment-form' title='8 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3313378729868810496'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3313378729868810496'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/04/springs-eternal.html' title='Springs Eternal'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8074157632679371216</id><published>2012-04-13T15:05:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.433-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>dfgdfgd</title><content type='html'></content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/' title='dfgdfgd'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8074157632679371216'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8074157632679371216'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.importType' value='IMPORTED_DRAFT'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-1433181992956251700</id><published>2012-04-08T03:44:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T15:31:49.675-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>warshawski photo</title><content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;

He's at his best impersonating. His impersonations are nothing groundbreaking, but they're infectious, and they do what they should: improve upon the source martial. So much so that the source material becomes completely lost, and the far more entertaining impersonation is all we remember. No one has become more lost and more improved by impersonation than Arnold Schwarzenegger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus watching any movie he's in is an excavation of the real Arnie, quickly thereafter forgotten. It's a disorienting thing--him and the activity of unearthing him. Imagine my shock at the first scene of "Total Recall", in which he is thrown into the Martian desert without a space suit, and he begins to scream. In a special effect that is unsettling as much for its gruesomeness as its cheesyness, his eyes bulge out of their sockets, and he emits the proto-Arnie-noise. You know, the one everyone does, from Dana Carvey to Dylan Moran to my D.: alwalwalwalwalw--a guttural vowel through jaws moving rhythmically up and down as if on an exercise machine. Undoubtedly that's how it began--as a jaw exercise. The amazing part about this is that even though I watched this only 24 hours ago, I have just described D.'s impression to you, not what I heard. Because I don't remember what I heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly the kind of tiresome mind-game that can sustain Phillip K. Dick's wonder. (He wrote the short story on which Total Recall was based, of course, as he did quite a few other fanboy-enshrined Sci-Fi films.) He subjects everything to the same kind of philosophical doubt, and so his work is a gold mine for film-makers aiming for the "let's smoke a bowl and watch something" crowd. The basic "whoa" in this film: Is the protagonist's experience a self-indulgent fantasy being synthetically pumped into him by--you guessed it--a sleazy corporation or is it real? It turns out that both his identity and his idealism are constructs intended to secure the corporation's monopoly. But oh no! It back-fires: He, the construct, fights to not be erased by his "true" identity, and triumphantly saves the world from the corporation's greed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among all this, there are innumerable funny Schwarzenegger noises, or action scenes as some call them. The unpathologized nonchalance with which he spins innocent bystanders into his heroic imperatives gave me pause. People who have barely met him sacrifice their lives for him, and then he uses their corpses as body shields. His role is comparable to one of the most gruesome weapons he wields in the film: an enormous hand-held drill. He uses it to drill all the way through the armor plating of a vehicle threatening to kill him and his sidekick/lover, and finally into the flesh of its operator. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's talk about something else. How about that this heavily accented actor is supposed to pass for a white American everyman? At the film's start he and Sharon Stone flounce about their apartment like the married couple you want to murder every time they come over for dinner. When he wakes up, she hounds him for information about this other girl in his recurring dream. He sulks, and watches the news on their enormous flat screen. She bitchily turns it off with the most awful smile (this perhaps is Stone's talent). He sulks some more, and then goes to work. Apparently, he's a construction worker. Like his more recent job as governor, one is always thinking that surely he's actually a body builder, and surely he's just visiting from Austria. Maybe he's actually perfect for both this role and in politics because his accent and mannerisms form a kind of cognitive bomb. One sees and then, in a flash of bent diphthongs and flexing muscle, one does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only part of all this worth watching as far as I'm concerned is Schwarzenegger being apathetic and sarcastic. It's a very brief scene, but unparalleled. He's watching a video of himself telling him what to do, because the one watching has contracted amnesia under duress. What he's watching, then, is the way back to himself. The route involves a lot of difficult, adventurous tasks, and he's depressed by this. "Yes, yes," he says, slouching, as if his wife just scolded him, and then, hearing the worst of it, "great," dripping with ennui. Captured on screen is the most honest reaction he's ever had to his life's work.</content><link rel='related' href='http://sweatingdark.blogspot.com/2012/04/total-recall.html' title='Total Recall'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/2949606769401039647/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/04/total-recall_709.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2949606769401039647'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2949606769401039647'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/04/total-recall_709.html' title='Total Recall'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1AWdfk44Snk/T3qXzZoewpI/AAAAAAAAERQ/FnHDA8pffNA/s72-c/total_recall_poorvas_morning.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8762868678815495176</id><published>2012-04-02T23:20:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T15:31:49.686-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>Alien: Resurrection</title><content type='html'>Before anyone gave a shit about him, much less revered him as a geek saint, Joss Whedon wrote the script for "Alien: Resurrection". It's not a particularly good movie. In fact, it's really, really bad (though not quite as bad James Cameron's rendition of the franchise, "Aliens"), but it's also, improbably, a cheeky deconstruction of ontology. Well, not exactly, but there are smatterings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor Signourney Weaver's unfortunate legacy, Ripley, lays unconscious on an operating table, pale as a vampire. In white coats that absurdly button at the shoulder, the doctors lean in to look intently at a smallish, bloody incision in the middle of her chest. "2 centimeters," one of them reports. Finally, someone is campily drawing out the connections that Freudian film theorists found irresistibly inarticulate in the previous "Alien" films, and is tapping them for comedy. When the doctors carefully extract the toothy, monstrous infant from the incision, their eyes fill with wonder and affection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's in the twee hands of Jean Jeunet, who saturates all the colors and renders everything even sillier. Still, everyone trades in human bodies. The scrappy pirates (a prefiguration of the Firefly crew) have salvaged cryogenically-frozen bodies from some derelict ship, and the Evil Corporation (or whatever) buys them to impregnate them with vicious, slimy aliens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These very Jeunet scientists have cloned Ripley from some cells recovered from the last movie in which she kills herself because she has an alien gestating inside her. Somehow, cloning her brings the alien along with her. The process has not done wonders to keep the two entities separate, so that even once they have removed the baby alien from her chest, she remains some sort of hybrid. As you might expect, this means she's somewhat of a superhero, more or less like Spider Man with acid blood. Weaver chooses to portray her hybridity in the hammiest way: by moving like a predatory animal. She tilts her head inquisitively, stares intently, and sniffs. Like the rest of the movie, she's ridiculous. Everybody says they don't trust her, because, you know, what is she?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the "oh no, we're stuck in a big spaceship with a bunch of homicidal aliens" part of the movie begins, Ripley wanders into a room marked "7" (she is marked "8"). Inside she's faced with a multitude of other possibilities of herself preserved in green fluid, all of them grotesque. There's a giant baby-looking-thing, a human with the head of an alien, a human with a tail and the claws of an alien, etc etc etc. What really disturbs her, though, is the one that's still alive, squirming around on an operating table, its not-entirely-human limbs at very wrong angles, moaning for Ripley to kill Ripley. She does, with a flamethrower, and destroys all the preserved clones gone wrong, too. She finds abjection writ large in these enormous test tubes, and she stamps it out. Violently denying the messiness of being, she claims her identity and posits herself as the true Ripley. Afterwards, the brute of the team says "What's the big deal? Fucking waste of ammo. Must be a chick thing," which is a sitcom line missing a laugh track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings us to Winona Ryder, who plays an android who has hidden its identity, called Call. (When Ripley learns that she's an android, she calls her "it".) It becomes apparent that Call is "synthetic" (so goes the lingo in this universe) because of a wound. The evil general who has put together this whole alien research operation shoots her. She tries to hide it, but Ripley sniffs it out, feels the hole dripping white goop (in the "Alien" movies, androids spew what appears to be white paint everywhere when they're injured). Call tells Ripley not to touch it, hating the reminder of what she is. Which is a surprisingly nice way of putting why the bloody insides of own bodies make us queasy. Ripley doesn't mind, and lovingly stuffs the wires and whatever back into the hole as best she can. In the same scene of bonding in imminence, Ripley asks Call to "jack in" to the ship's computer network, another odious reminder of the nature of Call's body. "It makes me feel all liquid inside," she complains. "Get over it," says Ripley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kind of overdrawn sci-fi metaphor normally irritates me with the heat of loathing for my adolescent self, but the B-movie tone of farce makes it bearable. These are themes played with (although not very coherently) rather than hammered into the viewer as if they're revelations. It's a comedy for college film students, and although I'm a couple years out, I'm still tickled.</content><link rel='related' href='http://sweatingdark.blogspot.com/2012/04/alien-resurrection.html' title='Alien: Resurrection'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8762868678815495176'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8762868678815495176'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.importType' value='IMPORTED_DRAFT'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-2782097272406175258</id><published>2012-03-29T05:35:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T19:45:43.769-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Potatoes</title><content type='html'>You know, I have no idea what the Irish Potato Famine was. All I have are some ideological props lamely disguised as history. It was the lack of biodiversity, you see, that did them in. Or more honestly the first thing that pops into my head is: Didn’t they know that potatoes are just empty carbs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is, the only way I can think of the victims of the famine is as poor fools. Too bad they had to learn the hard way what we now know! I mean, I guess. They got what was coming to them, right? When you think about it, the holocaust only happened because we didn’t yet know to kill every goose-stepping kraut on sight. After seven decades of deliberation, we’ve come to the conclusion that that’s what fascism is--martial dance moves and fermented cabbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, where was I? Oh yes, what even the Irish knew: Always keep potatoes in the dark. I say this, but I don’t do it. A whole army of them are spread on the kitchen counter, bearing obscene green protrusions. The poor things don’t know that there’s nothing for them to grow in. Expose them to the sunlight and they’ll just start sprouting, unaware that once they’ve used themselves up to make green shoots, there will be nothing to support them besides sunlight. Their roots will scour the counter for water and nutrients, and they’ll find nothing. They’ll wither and die. Which is probably for the best. Imagine if you were born into a vacuum. They keep clearing your mouth of mucus, but there is in fact nothing for you to breath. There is only one way to act on this knowledge, and it will happen anyway: you must die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of, I need some creative ways to preemptively exterminate these doomed spuds. I was thinking an oven. It’s an act of compassion. Sure, I could put them in soil, but come on, do you think there are enough holes in the ground for all of them? Besides, it’s so much responsibility. I have better things to do, like write this shit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve spent a lot of time waiting in vehicles for the driver to complete some errand (you know who you are), reading. The material varies. On better, less amusing days I’ve brought something with me, but sometimes it’s a pocket technical encyclopedia filled with trivia, sometimes it’s a tossed-aside (for good reason) magazine, and sometimes it’s a paperback, also tossed. When the driver gets back into the car, he inevitably gets an earful of whatever I’ve just entertained myself with during his absence. Imagine yourself the driver. One time it was the first chapter of some post-apocalyptic sci-fi. I think the premise was something like “and then the machines went kaput, because the nanomachines went berserk and murdered them, because nanomachines are evil, and, damn, now there’s a whole swarm of them, but only at low altitude, because real Americans live in the mountains.” As vague as &lt;i&gt;The Road&lt;/i&gt;, but more torturously rationalized. In any case, our story centered around a small group of survivors, who of course were fighting amongst themselves. The author had taken the post-apocalypse as a perfect stage to set his vision of The Way Things Really Are, which I understood to be men posturing a lot, heroically saving their perceived inferiors with Hard Leadership Decisions (the kind Bush made), and filling the air with a lot of self-justifying talk. Stuff like “Lucy, I know it’s hard, but we can’t cuddle just now--we’ve got to cook the dog.” Paired with potatoes. Apparently when the apocalypse comes, we’ll all be eating a lot of meat and potatoes. Not because that’s what’s around, but because that’s Real Food.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/03/potatoes.html' title='Potatoes'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/2782097272406175258/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/03/potatoes.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2782097272406175258'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2782097272406175258'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/03/potatoes.html' title='Potatoes'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8984129968589212939</id><published>2012-03-26T02:12:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.465-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Bananas and Caramel</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-C6PW218uJKA/T3Ax-ccJKNI/AAAAAAAAEPw/4H5mHqOsmcc/s1600/IMG_1056.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-C6PW218uJKA/T3Ax-ccJKNI/AAAAAAAAEPw/4H5mHqOsmcc/s320/IMG_1056.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;“Bananas are good,” David Tennant says in that loud cheer of his, and I can’t get it out of my head. There is something unfortunately infectious about the tenth doctor. It’s the confidence. I could say I watched Doctor Who for the amusingly transparent metaphoric premises, or because of the irreverence, maybe even for that glowing metal phallus he keeps at all times on his person, but those would all be ego-saving lies. If I am honest, I watched it for the same optimistic outlook that caused me to vomit each episode, but also, despite myself, to swagger a little. It’s not precisely that the the hero wins in the end, but the belief that the hero will win in the end. The solution to all problems in “Doctor Who” is intelligence, yes, but really it’s faith–the kind of faith in self-help books or self-actualizing seminars. Like Katy Perry, the doctor tries to pass on his affective strategy to virtually every human he encounters. Just believe that you are awesome (he assures that you are almost as awesome as him, his insistent praise becoming even more patronizingly voluble if you’re a woman), and the universe will open its doors to you. If you’re one of his chosen, that is–if he loves you. And he’s a slut. Being beneficent is such a knee-jerk for him that he bumbles around beknighting inanimate objects, too. Bananas are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_Bl-xdLPRGk/T3Ax_rUznHI/AAAAAAAAEQE/OLPQPicYPSU/s1600/IMG_1059.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_Bl-xdLPRGk/T3Ax_rUznHI/AAAAAAAAEQE/OLPQPicYPSU/s320/IMG_1059.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It’s true, though, and food, like the self, has to be mythologized for me to want to try it. Recently this happened to bananas for me in an odd way, and not because of Tennant’s ridiculous voice. My sudden fascination with bananas began because &lt;a href="http://www.cookingandme.com/2010/06/ethakka-appam-pazham-pori-banana.html"&gt;Kerala banana fritters&lt;/a&gt; were described to me as a textural marvel: soft and hot on the outside, and a little harder and cooler inside. I cringed a little at this, yet I was curious. Usually when dealing with things deep fried, it’s crispy exteriors and soft interiors that are valued. The pleasure of biting into something and feeling it gush. These fritters would instead be, at least in theory, the pleasure of hitting a semipermeable wall. Maybe it would be welcome, as it mirrors the combative conversational aesthetic I dishonestly claim to cherish. In any case, I was intrigued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--K0o7vAa_Wc/T3AyBAEpX-I/AAAAAAAAEQo/HOlikfsw-sY/s1600/IMG_1062.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--K0o7vAa_Wc/T3AyBAEpX-I/AAAAAAAAEQo/HOlikfsw-sY/s320/IMG_1062.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I was (and am) also lazy. When I mustered the motivation to do something with the slightly green bananas I bought, the only specificity that remained was the desire for bananas. I didn’t feel like bothering with batter, or with a recipe. So I just did what I apparently do with all fruit: I fried them in butter and sugar. This time, though, taking a cue from &lt;a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/316229/banana-bourbon-layer-cake"&gt;Martha Stewart’s banana cake&lt;/a&gt;, I also used bourbon. Bananas, butter, and bourbon–their alliteration surely points to destiny. If not, well, then just go back in time and make that the case. Such would be the dictates of the doctor’s intergalactic arrogance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This improvised preparation did not yield the texture that fascinated me, in part because the bananas had become ripe by the time I had gotten around to them. Just the same old, same old: slightly crispy exterior and soft, gooey interior. The appeal of the flavor of bananas, however, was made undeniable by these hot, greasy globs. I ate the whole pan in an hour. The bananas did not fight back. There was no solidity to be found, but they offered something else to keep me going–a scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VWCNQLxM7aY/T3AyBtyzupI/AAAAAAAAEQg/K20DSA-aRdQ/s1600/IMG_1063.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VWCNQLxM7aY/T3AyBtyzupI/AAAAAAAAEQg/K20DSA-aRdQ/s320/IMG_1063.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The scent is powerful enough that I will soon try to perfect this recipe for the fourth time. The problem is the caramel. It’s pointless. I insist upon it because friend bananas are somehow not exciting enough, but every time it turns nearly to hard candy. On top of the melted butter that the bananas haven’t soaked up I drop half a cup of sugar. As soon as it melts, it’s as brown as a white body-builder. I pour the stuff immediately onto the limp pile of fried bananas, looking like the corpses of pregnant slugs. The plate’s unctuous mess of textures is unwelcoming. Just as I begin to savor the banana, a chunk of caramel latches onto my teeth and won’t let go. I have to chew it, clamping together and unsticking my jaws with difficulty. I want the caramel in the same way that I want to eat a whole bag of potato chips–it disgusts me but I keep stuffing more of it in my mouth. I’m trying very hard to use it to scratch the itch that it has given me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When finally I have created my masterpiece, with a caramel sauce instead of a coating of sugary land-mines, I hope I will move to the subtler territory of fritters.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/03/bananas-and-caramel.html' title='Bananas and Caramel'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8984129968589212939'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8984129968589212939'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-C6PW218uJKA/T3Ax-ccJKNI/AAAAAAAAEPw/4H5mHqOsmcc/s72-c/IMG_1056.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.importType' value='IMPORTED_DRAFT'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-6131165773372693474</id><published>2012-03-18T01:41:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T19:45:43.777-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Caramel Pears</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_foHsURGNsU/T150buNES1I/AAAAAAAAEJs/9zPNwPi7KvU/s1600/IMG_1054.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_foHsURGNsU/T150buNES1I/AAAAAAAAEJs/9zPNwPi7KvU/s320/IMG_1054.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Whether out of laziness, haste, aesthetics, or as a gift to my wheat-allergic brother, I’ve decided crusts are for the birds.

I enter the supermarket in a mental fog, and mumble to myself “dessert…” As sure as a wallpaper pattern my answer to this nonquestion moves from apples to apples to apples. I stare at the Golden Delicious, a little hesitant: is there something else? Not really, but this time I went for pears. A stain on the wallpaper. Same thing, different fruit. Peel them, quarter them, settle them in a hot pan of sugar and butter, boil them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I tried pears, I didn’t want to write anything about the sweet paradigm I had stumbled into. There was something magic about how well the caramel-bathed apples came out each time, with so little effort. I wanted to keep my little loophole secret. This meant, of course, that I harbored a pride about it, which reared its ugly head when I brought my apples (mine, mine) out of the house. One of my hosts, biting into one of these apples, exclaimed in pleasure that it was one of the finest pears he had ever tasted. He was right--soft and stewed in sugar, it did taste like pear. I always hate any exchange of recipes, and especially when they come from myself. But there I was, specifying with gross excitement that the caramel takes six, not five minutes to develop. I could’ve used a bubbling, superheated pool of caramel to jump into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mortified, and stuck in a stupefyingly retrograde metaphysics, I had to advance from seeming to the real thing: I had to use pears. I should have known that what tantalized was glimpsing another flavor just on the horizon. To go directly toward the glimpse was as inevitable as it was misguided. It all would have been okay, I keep telling myself, had I used more pears, or less sugar. When it was just cool enough to try, my brother and I bit into this fruity, saucy mess as if it were heaven. It was. We had another bite. Our eyes bulged, and we yearned for water and other flavorlessness. While we had a hard time staying away from all of the preceding plates of buttery apples, more than a few bites of these pears could not be managed. They were too sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence crusts. Still, the two of us finished the plate off in a few days.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/03/caramel-pears.html' title='Caramel Pears'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6131165773372693474/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/03/caramel-pears.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6131165773372693474'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6131165773372693474'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/03/caramel-pears.html' title='Caramel Pears'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_foHsURGNsU/T150buNES1I/AAAAAAAAEJs/9zPNwPi7KvU/s72-c/IMG_1054.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4288632921221444714</id><published>2012-03-06T16:57:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T15:39:03.434-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>Pina</title><content type='html'>In "Pina", nothing ever goes wrong. Dancers dance on a wet floor, on a precipice, in the road, and in a room full of chairs. None slip (without being choreographed to do so), fall (likewise), run into chairs, or get hit by cars. In these dances, the possibility of an accident is constantly thrown in my eyes like sublime sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a theme of women falling over to be caught by men. The gravitational potential of her body shoots invisibly through his anticipatory movements. He follows her like a grave, loving spotter, and when she falls forward, he catches her at the last moment before her nose hits the concrete. The audience doesn't quite know what to do with this. It's almost slapstick, but deadpan, modernist. Laughter flares uncertainly through the theater in short fits. Her face is never allowed to make contact with the ground. He saves her from it, but what kind of salvation is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A similar dance features a woman not falling face-first, but tipping to the side like a ship in a storm. As before, there is a man to keep her from going over. He keeps close and watches her intently, moving quickly to the perilous side when necessary and kneeling to catch her. She walks and looks forward, zombie-like. When at unpredictable intervals she falls to the side, her eyes do not move. He must keep her on track, keep her from haplessly deviating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each dancer in the troupe gives a short monologue. One of them explains lovingly how much Pina loved obstacles. In one of her productions, "Cafe Mueller", the floor is filled with chairs. There is, of course, a man whose role is to move chairs out of the way of dancers who, seeming not to notice the chairs underfoot, would otherwise trip. His work is frantic as the other dancers move wildly about the cluttered space. He makes no false move. He deprives them of clumsiness, their one avenue of expression. While moving chairs is anything but quiet, and the movements of the dancers are anything but understated, nonetheless a tense, kinetic hush settles over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one dance in which a dancer falls, so predetermined it stings with the caustic amusement of a pompous psychoanalyst. It made the audience so uncomfortable that they laughed sincerely. A man and a woman embrace firmly, both looking needy but on the brink of satiation. They don't move, but a man with the suit, hairstyle, and manner of Agent Smith comes over to them. He rearranges them into a flipbook of passion--their hands to each other's hips, their lips onto each other's, and then he lays her whole into the still man's outstretched arms, as if supposed to carry her to bed in a cliche. As soon as the stern arranger of limbs lets go, she slips out of the arms, and falls to the floor. It looks like it hurts. She picks herself up and again the two embrace, seeming to be rescuing each other from the trauma that just occurred. Sternness turns to anger in the superegoical overseer, and he repeats the whole thing over again, faster. It repeats over and over. Their breathing becomes loud and rapid. It ends with the two embraced. The angle of the camera reveals a bloody spot on her ankle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The accident is routed back into itself. To my rapt frustration, nothing ever happens. I have never been more convinced that beauty and terror are the same thing.</content><link rel='related' href='http://sweatingdark.blogspot.com/2012/03/pina.html' title='Pina'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/4288632921221444714/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/03/pina_2252.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4288632921221444714'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4288632921221444714'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/03/pina_2252.html' title='Pina'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-6580936121394445265</id><published>2012-03-04T17:58:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T19:45:43.778-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Tacos at Agave</title><content type='html'>If you have any sense, I won’t be able to convince you that the tacos at Agave are anything other than mediocre. But once, under the influence of oxytocin and a little alcohol, I ate tacos there that can only be described as transcendent. I objected to the aesthetics of them--the repackaging of Mexican food as self-consciously healthful and mild--yet I could not deny the sheer pleasure of biting into one. There are advantages to Mexico as discovered by yuppies over Mexico as imported nostalgically over the border by immigrants. For one, the meat was cooked perfectly, meltingly, rather than grilled or fried to a crisp. Wait, sorry, that’s the only thing. But that went a long way, and everything else was good. The salsa, while it lacked heat, had the sharp and sweet flavors of cilantro and fresh tomatoes of the non-insipid variety. The tortillas were at once crisp and soft, not stale, damp, and falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t think about any of this then--I was too surprised at how thoroughly I enjoyed it. I had scoffed at this place every time I passed its signage that proudly displays a plant as if it’s a revelation. Imagine if it had been named “Cabbage”. Though perhaps it should have been. There’s plenty of cabbage on the menu, and the only agave for sale is in the form of tequila. You may need it, if their sunny attempts to transport you to Mexico fail and you’re forced to face the food under the garish grey light of these latitudes in winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These transcendent tacos, they are only known by one other person, the same who I lunched with. It was pushing our luck to go back to Agave after sharing such gustatory delight there. It is to the cook’s credit that the tacos deluded us into thinking that they emanated from some ontic stability, to which we could return at our leisure. We did. The tacos literally fell apart in my hands, despite their wet innards being quarantined by two tortillas. The tortillas had come out of a bag, probably one that was at least two days old. The moldy aftertaste came from precisely that. The foundation on which tacos are built had sloughed onto our plates. What was left?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First we denied anything was amiss. Then we balked, and, finally, we rationalized. That first halcyon visit, we had come at around four when hardly anyone had been here (this second time it was 1pm). The cook must have had the time to take real care with the food, and probably there had been a different cook. Maybe they normally use fresh tortillas, but ran out today. Yes, yes, the lunchtime rush, the cook, that must be it. The experience, no, it was real, surely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, we were busy with the wait staff, maintaining our own delusion, or maybe the restaurant’s, I’m really not sure any more. How is everything? Oh, good--no, delicious! The performance of enthusiasm that flares up in the friction between professionally doting waiters and polite customers can get a bit scary. The line between cheeriness and violence feels thin. The same unnaturally widened eyes could belong to someone yelling “good, I’m glad you like it!” at you or to someone stabbing you with a chef’s knife. I’m grateful whenever the fervor dies down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came the flan. It more or less broke my mind. It came with a purple orchid, which my companion optimistically took as a personal gift from our cute waitress. If the flan was a part of this gift, it was the most mixed signal I’ve ever received. Of course, as it is with mixed signals, I wasn’t sure what part of it came from myself. Settling a slightly warm chunk of creamy custard onto my tongue with a spoon, I was given a wave of nausea. Whence? The texture was lovely, the flavor was at once strong caramel and smooth milk, and it was sweet but not overpoweringly sweet. I put another morsel in my mouth, and felt instantly gravitated toward the floor. It was perfect, yet I was not inhaling it, I was choking it down. I wanted to throw it back up, yet I ate my entire share of it. Our waitress glowingly asked us “how is the flan?” I must have looked stunned and indecisive, like a squirrel getting run down by a car. Thankfully, my companion swooped in to say “bliss”. I wasn’t sure if this was intended for our dessert or for the girl who served it to us, who seemed satisfied with the answer in whichever way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hardly remember the bill, or even going out the door. Eating there had sunk me deep into an epistemological crisis.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/03/tacos-at-agave.html' title='Tacos at Agave'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6580936121394445265/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/03/tacos-at-agave.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6580936121394445265'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6580936121394445265'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/03/tacos-at-agave.html' title='Tacos at Agave'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-7467433963239537612</id><published>2012-03-03T11:23:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T19:45:43.779-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Spiced Apple Pie with Dulce de Leche</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.esquire.com/cm/esquire/images/9A/esq-apple-pie-recipe-0312-lg.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://www.esquire.com/cm/esquire/images/9A/esq-apple-pie-recipe-0312-lg.jpg" width="274" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;Esquire&lt;/em&gt;? For reasons still unknown to me at the time of writing this, someone left an issue on my bed open to a recipe for “Spiced Apple Pie with Dulce de Leche”. Not bad. A little boring, but not a terrible idea to add spice and caramel sauce to apple pie. I wasn’t sure why the minimal conceit demanded a full-fludged recipe complete with retro-styled full-page photos, but whatever. Actually, who am I kidding. It’s one of the most pointlessly over-blinged desserts I’ve ever heard of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I flipped around, and discovered other mediocre recipes coupled with raunchy food photography. Hold on--I see what’s going on here. These aren’t recipes. They’re ads. The spiced apple pie is an ad for Eagle Brand condensed milk. I have to admit, this may not have been money poorly spent on Eagle’s part, whoever they are. Apparently this is all a part of “The Esquire Pantry Hall of Fame”--a series of recipes complete with specification readouts--“CHEF:”, “MAKES:”, “PRODUCT:”--as if stenciled on a piece of military equipment. The reason for both pieces of painfully articulated information is the same: to destroy any possibility of ambiguity for readers who can’t be trusted unfold a napkin. You don’t want troops firing bazookas into their faces, or bachelors not knowing how much pie they’re making, or what brand of condensed milk to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was confused. Some dimly-remembered rumor led me to believe that Esquire had content, somewhere. I searched. All I found was something about Willem Defoe, his grim face in black and white filling the entire opposite page (this magazine certainly makes use of its glossy paper). It wasn’t an article, it was a hagiography of quotations, the first of which I wish he had taken to heart more rigorously: “There’s a real wisdom to not saying anything.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scouring the pages for anything but ads, all I could find were nearly-nude photos of Kate Upton staring lasciviously at the camera, presenting her breasts as if they were prize pumpkins. In the first photo they’re being barely contained by a loose bra, to which she is taking scissors. Do they have a panel of 13-year-old boys, or do they come up with this stuff all on their own?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I stopped straining, and realized the nicest--admittedly the only--thing about the magazine is its fashion ads. Once I thought of it as a catalogue of mens clothing, it provided entertainment. (This whole rant is essentially an admission of how bored I am.) Of a sort. If I see one more suede desert boot, one more casual suit, one more appeal to the reader’s alleged uniqueness...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait, I finally get it: My dad wants me to make apple pie.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/03/spiced-apple-pie-with-dulce-de-leche.html' title='Spiced Apple Pie with Dulce de Leche'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/7467433963239537612/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/03/spiced-apple-pie-with-dulce-de-leche.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7467433963239537612'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7467433963239537612'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/03/spiced-apple-pie-with-dulce-de-leche.html' title='Spiced Apple Pie with Dulce de Leche'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-3212994379386939103</id><published>2012-03-01T23:38:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T19:45:43.772-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Grain Moths</title><content type='html'>Have you ever eaten a grain moth? I probably have, though I really couldn't tell you for certain. Our kitchen is full of them, and they fling themselves thoughtlessly at any sticky object. As a result, any food that is left out for more than about fifteen minutes attracts a garnish of grey little bodies. Stubbornly, we still leave butter out in an uncovered dish. Their inadvertent suicides make Gary Larson-esque portraits of themselves in silhouette against the bright, opaque yellow of the butter--legs askew, wings flattened. It's incredible how frail and malleable these exoskeletoned creatures are. When I accidentally run across one with a butter knife, it smears, leaving behind unknown essences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We keep our cast-iron pan always on the stove, always with a sheen of oil. We do this because we don’t want to ruin it by subjecting it to soap. It accumulates a grime of fried egg, vegetable, cheese, and bread that sometimes I scrape off with a paper towel, or with the spatula, which is fairly ineffective. Only when I scrape do I notice the moths that have died there. They have been fried to a crispy consistency, and saturated with oil, darkening them them to a color indistinguishable from the pan. Hundreds if not thousands of them have been infused in the iron patina. The pan imparts many flavors to what is cooked in it, and one of them is grain moth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am both nauseated and blase about their ubiquity on and in things I'm about to eat. I usually just try to take the butter that isn't directly touching one of their corpses. Unlike ants, they do not release an offensive smell when crushed. They are not sour, or at least I don't think they are. What does a grain moth taste like? I'm frightened to find out, even though I suspect they taste like nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their frequent failure to navigate the kitchen to suitable sustenance in which to lay their eggs is apparently not enough to slow them down much. On some days their swarm extends even outside the kitchen, and every day I see at least one, usually more. I've stopped being surprised. Today one fluttered out of an egg carton that had been in the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think that the grain moths would induce one of us to clean up and get rid of what feeds them. There are cupboards with countless forgotten bags, boxes, and unsealed jars of flour, beans, lentils, rice, noodles, and oatmeal. There's also a giant open bag of birdseed. Somewhere in there, they're feasting and breeding. I wouldn't say they're pleased by this bounty, but they do multiply accordingly. With indifference and neglect we keep providing for them. Yes, we could make life harder or even possibly impossible for them, but we don't bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I would really like to get rid of them, but the prospect of going through all that pantry cruft we've accumulated over the decades is too daunting. Who even knows what's in there. Maybe I'll find out when I've found out what one of one the maggots feeding on it tastes like.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/03/grain-moths.html' title='Grain Moths'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/3212994379386939103/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/03/grain-moths.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3212994379386939103'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3212994379386939103'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/03/grain-moths.html' title='Grain Moths'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-5084453310755240968</id><published>2012-03-01T14:50:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.387-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Sustenance of Another Sort</title><content type='html'>We show our literacy of assumptions with “and” and “but”. Does the next statement follow from the previous? If not, we are compelled to connect the two with "but", not "and". The best "but" I've ever seen is on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Paretsky"&gt;the Wikpedia page&lt;/a&gt; for Sara Paretsky, the author of the V.I. Warshawski mysteries. It's practically mooning us:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"[Warshawski] drinks Johnnie Walker Black Label, breaks into offices looking for clues, and can hold her own in a street fight. But she also pays attention to her clothes, sings opera along with the radio, and enjoys her sex life." I read this, laughed, and knew I had to read these books. Apparently, you have to be one kind of woman or the other, and Warshawski is both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time in the series she has sex, this is how it is described: "My last memory was of his breath expelling loudly, and then I was asleep." Like everything is in her narration, sex is just there. She describes everything unblinkingly, without troubling herself with it. It is for this cold honesty I read. Her voice is a soothing narcotic, stripping the world of melodrama, sometimes sharpening to sarcasm. The sarcasm is the deflective aspect of her persona. Her voice is double-edged like this, too, in her interactions with those from whom she wants information--she fences, alternately thrusting and parrying her way to their throats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While she is obsessed with rooting out the truth, she is the anti-House. Her blunt honesty and wit do not emanate from despair, there is no Man of Genius torment to romance here, and her jokes are not adolescent vies for attention. “House” the show is content with repeatedly calling its eponymous character “incapable of human connection” with the same zeal that children yell at the opposite sex that they have “cooties”. Paretsky does not hold her protagonist at such a confused and aroused distance. Warshawski is not written as if she's repressing some deep sentimentality; she's just not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not surprising, then, that she talks about sex in a matter-of-fact way. But there is something just a bit off about this description of her rendezvous with Ralph. In the next novel, &lt;em&gt;Deadlock&lt;/em&gt;, she reports of a new lover that "he made love as well as he had kissed," which is a great deal cheerier, a bit less removed, and not nearly as funny. Evenness, it seems, has yet to be reached in this first novel. Perhaps everything is bound to be a little much for a writer eager to use the novel as a foil to define this nascent character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Wikipedia might have said is that she enjoys her sex life but she does not build her sense of self out of romance. On her date with Ralph it's clear that he's emotionally invested and wants her, whereas she likes him, and thinks sex would be nice--“I’d like the comfort of someone in bed with me,” she considers. Her interest is in that, and (as ever) in a potential source of information, not in anything erotic in the Anne Carson sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the two enter her apartment, the romantic poetics of oneness are out. They both get what they want, more or less, but she's using his desire for her while he's hoping for some deeper reciprocation from her. The funny thing is, he'll twist almost anything he gets from her into what he wants. Their dinner conversation is rife with polite discord (the least sexy kind of discord), which she internally ascribes to class difference and accepts, and he refuses to acknowledge. He fundamentally misunderstands her, but he still wants her. She is utterly knowing, realizing that “he had been planning this ending all along”, but not knowing in that sweet way with which romcom heroines delude themselves into bliss. She simply doesn't expect anything much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's troubling about the whole scene in her apartment is that she thinks one thing and does another--really not her M.O.. Sitting on the couch drinking with him she thinks "it had been a long time since I had anyone up to my apartment, and I suddenly felt shy and vulnerable. I'd been overexposed to men today and wasn't ready to do it again in bed." Reading this, I assumed that she was about to politely ask Ralph to leave. He might be confused, but she would not be guilted into sex, and that would be that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t, though, because she finds a way to control the situation. (She would be the last person to victimize herself. Giving in for someone else’s sake is a tendency that exasperates her in women.) Red-faced, he admits his soupy feelings for her in a series of cliches (“you’re not like any woman I ever met before,” which is undoubtedly true). This shift of vulnerability perks her right up. She takes him by the hand to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How gravely Ralph misunderstands her becomes apparent in the morning. Recently divorced, he eagerly falls into domestic life with her. He fusses about making coffee, doing her dishes, kissing her breezily, and in a flurry of honeymoon whimsey suggests that they take the day off at some relaxing locale. For her this last falls under the category of things the suburban upper-middle-class do, and moreover she doesn’t care to. She has work to do. When she refuses, he wants to come with her. Apparently, he thinks now that they’ve had sex, never shall they be separated. She tells him she wants the day to herself, and he sulks. He thought he’d found salvation, a woman in whom to cathect his ex-wife, but her more earnest needs are met elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;~&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been sent in Warshawski’s direction by the same friend who demanded I hop on the bandwagon of “The Killing”. She said that Warshawski takes further the lack of empathy that I liked so much in Sarah Lund. “Liked” is not the word. “The Killing” at this point held my psyche in &lt;a href="http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/01/appetite-of-sarah-lund.html"&gt;its grip&lt;/a&gt; so tightly that I even watched half of the second season, despite its numerous shortcomings. I needed Lund--her limpheartedness for the living, her all-consuming need to pursue the case. Everything else was gross and irritating, just as everything outside the investigation is to Lund. I was in need of Warshawski, badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is a different sort from Lund--far less troubled and therefore potentially brewing of more feminist trouble. Lund’s lack of heart is pathologized, and she is made to suffer for it. Whether it’s the world of the show or the show itself that censures her for being single-mindedly passionate about her work is unclear. It is clear that for Paretsky it is the world that would hold her protagonist back if it had the chance. To represent this world we have a verbal punching bag of a character, Bobby Mallory--a cop who shows up to try to browbeat Warshawski into being a housewife. He’s comic relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paretsky’s prose has that smooth digestibility of not over-processing. Like the character, the writing does not torture itself, but has come to conclusions about the world and has accepted them. Warshawski is not a probing narrator in the academic way. This could easily become an awfully broad definition of genre versus literary fiction--the point is that Warshawski’s potency as a character lies not in how high-brow the writing is, but in how addictively compelling it is on the mystery genre’s terms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not unusually, she narrates in the past tense. Her ascetic description, while it is also the non-grappling of genre fiction, is what's left. It is a story not embellished but paired down to what's worth remembering. What remains of sex is this errant blip of sensory data. The tumult of fantasy forgotten, she almost cruelly records his exhalation. This is not what you recount to your lover to recreate the mood: I fell asleep when you orgasmed last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While her love life has a mild flavor of noncrisis--its demands and rewards are small--her work has a tendency to threaten her well-being to the same degree that it sustains her psychologically. If the first two books of the series are an indication, in every story there are at least two crises that jeopardize Warshawski’s life. In the middle of &lt;em&gt;Deadlock&lt;/em&gt;, the freighter she’s on is blown up while it waits in a lock, and at the end she narrowly escapes the murderer murdering her on his yacht by setting it on fire and jumping overboard. In &lt;em&gt;Indemnity Only&lt;/em&gt; first it’s a mobster who gives her a black eye that in public everyone takes for a sign of domestic violence, then confronted in the end is (again) the culprit himself with friends and guns, whom she and her teenaged friend outwit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the face of disaster, her focus and disregard (not one without the other) are something to behold. The freighter broken in the now empty lock, her love interest on board and in shock (so is she), she trots up out of the lock past the crowd, gets a hamburger and fries (”I instinctually knew I needed the carbs”), and calls from a payphone on a hunch that she might know where the man is who detonated the explosives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Indemnity Only&lt;/em&gt; she is placed bruised, battered, and exhausted in her car. She’s just been in a fight with two thugs, and then her face and vital organs were beaten by their boss as an intimidation tactic. Sure, first she goes home and takes a bath (her restorative), but an hour later? She goes on the aforementioned date with Ralph. Covering up her purple face with makeup, she rushes off, ostensibly because she’s late and wants to prove she wants to see him. I find myself wondering if she just can’t stand being deterred by the recent trauma, and if she wants not to lose him as a source. In fact, I’d prefer those explanations. My attachment to her character comes through in these moments of rigid interpretation: Conciliation is not her bag, I stubbornly think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In neither story does she get much of any recompense for her travails. She doesn’t really ask for it. She may be a private investigator, but the profitable part of her job takes place outside the story. &lt;em&gt;Indemnity Only&lt;/em&gt; begins with her being hired to find someone’s daughter, but when this client fires her, she can’t help herself. She must get to the bottom of what he’s hiding. &lt;em&gt;Deadlock&lt;/em&gt; lacks even that pretense of employment: Her cousin dies, and she suspects it’s murder. Financially and in every other sense these cases take and take, but they’re all that give her back what’s crucial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The abandon with which she detects is erotic. Her rationality comes together and apexes exactly where it falls apart, in the investigation. Towards its end she will strain, deceive, push, and violate others, and nearly annihilate herself. What is that if not love? I do not ask rhetorically.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/03/sustenance-of-another-sort.html' title='Sustenance of Another Sort'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/5084453310755240968'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/5084453310755240968'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.importType' value='IMPORTED_DRAFT'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4487136356945666729</id><published>2012-02-26T00:36:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T19:45:43.776-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Coffee</title><content type='html'>I never understood people’s contentions about which kinds of alcohol do what to you, until coffee, as nasty and nationally appealing as my country’s home-brewed religions, gave me a revelation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trained to be a skeptic of the vulgar, scientific variety--the kind who criticize movies for their apparent misunderstandings of basic physics and feel very clever for it--I didn't get it. While I was too self-conscious to say so, I always thought "alcohol is alcohol." It seemed ridiculous to think that minor differences in flavor compounds (oh lord) make wine, whiskey, vodka, gin, and rum put you in profoundly different moods and give you variously painful or mild hangovers. It was all, I assumed, superstition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I had a cup of coffee that had a faint but unmistakeable odor of feces, and not only zealously emptied my lower intestine of that substance, but gave me the light-headed sensation that I might fall over walking around the supermarket. In other words, it had all the usual effects of coffee, but worse. It was the most destructively vile coffee I've ever had. What is particularly troubling about it is that the coffee shop that served it to me arrived at this new blend after a rigorous series of taste tests. There were six varieties, and a two-page taste-testing form. What they have carefully blended is something wonderful: a substance so offensive you can blame your mood on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With coffee, what is awful (or even, faddishly, offal) can be best. Or quite possibly it’s just me. Whenever I make coffee my father’s eyes bulge out of their sockets and he says, in a vast understatement, “do you think you made it a little strong?" His horror is completely justified. This morning, after tasting the stuff I had brewed, I warned him without exaggerating much that “it’s motor oil.” It was black and searingly bitter, as if the soap hadn’t been rinsed out of the pot. After a few gulps, such things become secretly sweet in the mouth. The bitterness, meanwhile, moves into the blood stream. The body shakes. The mind tears the bearable dullness of the world into a sharp-edged collage. The soul burns. No wonder America loves Jesus and coffee equally: one reportedly saves from the other.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/02/passion-of-coffee.html' title='Coffee'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/4487136356945666729/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/02/coffee.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4487136356945666729'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4487136356945666729'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/02/coffee.html' title='Coffee'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-5769153050785318663</id><published>2012-02-20T02:40:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.392-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Guest Post by Sneha Rajaram</title><content type='html'>I was one of those raving converts to non-vegetarian food that one hears about but never wants to meet, because, well, eating meat is great but it really doesn’t need to be a religion. It has enough going for it already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was born in a Brahmin, vegetarian family and was skinny as a child with no great appreciation of food. After meandering with the “veg vs. non-veg” ethical debate for years, I realized that whether I ate veg or non-veg, I was putting cruelty into my mouth, wearing it, talking to it, working for it, living under its roof anyway. The prominent sight of chickens in cages, raised under the inhuman conditions of battery farming, seems to have created tunnel vision for us. We don’t care as much about the extinction of other species of wild rice in favour of the one we’re eating, about the suicidal farmers growing the cotton we wear, or the quality of life of crops grown in pesticide and sterility. Plants don’t flap around cutely on wings, squawk when killed or peer pitifully out of transport boxes. And the thing we don’t see most of all is the human-to-human cruelty intrinsic to an economy that will bring commodities right to your doorstep for a few pieces of paper or zeroes on a computer screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided I would try meat some day. But, having a sadly dramatic temperament, I couldn’t just prosaically walk into a restaurant and order chicken, oh no. At 20, I spent a week in an NGO which worked with lower-castes. I was welcomed warmly by the employees and vegetarian food was cooked especially for me. So here’s where I must sheepishly admit I overrode their consideration and ate my very first chicken out of what I thought was caste-based political correctness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The response to my first meal of chicken seemed to come more from my body than from my tongue. To my tongue it simply tasted vaguely better than eggs. The texture, however, was brand new. The fibrous, soft and satisfyingly chewy meat told me my days of feeling skinny and invisible were over. This was solider food, closer to my body, than any plant- or fungus-derived food I’d ever eaten. This kind of texture felt like cavalry reinforcements after a long battle using infantry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At my next few meals, the long-suffering NGO workers guided me through several dishes of chicken and mutton: “That’s right, eat the heart,” they’d say, “It’s good for you.” My brain would balk at the word (I have a heart, but no leaves or roots) but my body didn’t feel any revulsion, and I soon got over the anatomy, even welcomed the knowledge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I returned from the NGO like Moses from Mount Sinai, it was with the euphoria of the newly converted. I fancied I was raging with a hunger born of generations of vegetarianism, and blamed my caste and ancestors. My parents received the news equanimously, but outside the family I was teased: One friend said “Snakes on a Plane” should really be “Brahmins eating meat”. Another meat-eating lady told me deadpan that my villi – finger-like things lining the intestines to absorb nutrients – had been spoilt by 20 years of roughage so I could never be a true meat-eater. And I spent weeks picturing and worrying about my poor abraded villi. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A whole new community brought itself to my attention. Family friends took me out to a Konkan seafood restaurant for the first time and showed me how to eat fish (for years I was a single-minded and ponderous bone-picker, taking hours to eat fish). The fish we ordered was really closer to vegetarian food than chicken, being soft and not in the least chewy, but here the taste really showed itself. I instinctively knew it didn’t need the masala it had been served in. What could be more naturally tangy, spicy and tasty than fish? The answer came in the next course: prawns. When I fell instantly in love with prawns, I started wondering why our predecessors ever wanted to migrate from the ocean to land. Maybe that’s why seafood has a special place in every meat-eater’s heart. I was invited to stay in a friend’s house, where her mother cooked pork and beef, which I also loved. The fatty bits in pork are my favourite kind of non-veg to this day, six years later. Beef, of course, was the culmination of my sense of a reinforced physical confidence. (Here I may be giving the impression that this was the main reason I liked meat. It was one of the reasons. But more than that, for me, meat was lust for life embodied, and it gave me something non-intellectual to be passionate about, at a time when I desperately needed both.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did relax in a couple of years, though. I used my mouth to eat meat rather than talk about it. And when I went abroad, it seemed the most natural thing in the world to eat it every day, which I hadn’t done before. The Turkish Döner kebabs being cheap and delicious, I ate lamb every day. In four weeks the protein had made my hair grow a few inches longer and a bit thicker, and my nails were shining. When I made social rounds and was asked if there was anything I didn’t eat, I replied proudly, “Humans”. A friend’s husband cooked my first venison, and even my inexperienced palette could tell the solid yet melty cutlets were very special. Having had a hunting license since the time when he had no choice but to hunt for food during the collapse of East Germany, he showed me a hunting book, pointing out the exact kind of deer I was eating. Their East German neighbour dropped in to tell us how he recently saw roadkill while driving, thought to himself, “Mm, tasty!” and took it home for dinner, much to his daughter’s mortification, since she’d grown up in unified Germany and hadn’t known that kind of food scarcity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The morning after that dinner I was given bread, jam and butter to eat for breakfast. My hostess also produced a bowl of some brown, salty, chunky spread. I put some on my bread to be polite and tried it, and it was simply fantastic. The little bits just melted in my mouth; I wanted to finish off the whole box without bread. When asked about it, my hostess said airily, “Oh that’s octopus! But don’t tell anyone I eat it, they’ll think I’m pregnant.” Naturally not worried about immaculate conception, I ate that octopus the entire weekend, and loved every morsel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days later I arrived at an NRI friend’s house and stuffed my face gratefully with home-cooked sambar rice, curd rice and dosa. Imagine my surprise (or maybe not) when I woke up the next morning to an upset stomach! If I hadn’t been groaning on a toilet I think I could’ve safely said that my conversion was complete. But the journey wasn’t over. I was going to taste camel and squid two years later, and now my list still has snake, rabbit, pigeon, duck, monkey, dog…&lt;span id="internal-source-marker_0.7034105935599655"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/02/guest-post-by-sneha-rajaram.html' title='Guest Post by Sneha Rajaram'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/5769153050785318663/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/02/guest-post-by-sneha-rajaram.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/5769153050785318663'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/5769153050785318663'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/02/guest-post-by-sneha-rajaram.html' title='Guest Post by Sneha Rajaram'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-6923305942774244505</id><published>2012-02-19T18:50:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T15:39:03.441-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>Dune</title><content type='html'>Let me tell you about something remarkable. A movie so impressed me that I’m dying to tell you about it. I’m positively giddy. How couldn’t I be? It’s the worst movie ever, and I’ve watched it somewhere in the realm of a dozen times. For me it’s one of those adolescent artifacts that nobody ever tells you is going to stubbornly stick with you like pencil lead under the skin, or that tiny red spot under my right eye. Actually, they’re like neither of those things, because the culture you haplessly consume in teenagerdom is infectious, ever aspiring to bring everyone else down to its level. For this reason I never stop quoting "The Simpsons", or--ugh--"Monty Python and the Holy Grail". Psychoanalysis gets it right, but misses the point: Yes, we're doomed to endlessly repeat our childhood traumas, but more importantly we're doomed to repeat the inane television we watched when we were twelve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, not every thing I gobbled back then comes back up tasting entirely of disease. For instance, The Far Side has left indelible bite-marks in my consciousness. I remember one strip quite clearly, in which two crocodiles, distended bellies up, are laying on a beach. In a smashed-up boat, the empty clothing and effects of two humans are at the happy crocodiles' feet. One crocodile says to the other: “wow, that was incredible--pink, soft all the way through, no bones, or nothin’.” Which is a perfect description of the movie in question, “Dune”. It really is an achievement--a movie this long without the slightest hint of tension or movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People talk about the intricately plotted political intrigue in Frank Herbert's book. Don't believe them. I've read it, and can say unequivocally that they're imagining things. Of course, I don't remember one word of the book, but that's not the point. I probably can't remember any of it either because I was too of a piece with Herbert’s version of eastern wisdom, or because I, like David Lynch, was reading only for atmosphere. The resulting movie is pure atmosphere--hazy, ridiculous, Lynchian atmosphere. Maybe he too read it ensconced in a canyon crevice in Utah, soaking up Desertness and the most stiltedly philosophical navel-gazers you’ve ever met. Of course I was--the characters were just as bad as me. (Okay, I take it back, I guess I remember something, after all.) In any case, all the movie can remember of the complex politics (if there ever were any) is one line: “I see plans within plans."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, all I see, in close-up, is the fascinatingly not-quite vaginal animatronic monster mouth that utters this--a drooping, undulating thing that in all other parts of the movie spews orange at planets. Apparently, this is the effect of being mutated over a period of 4,000 years by an expensive substance. "But," you interject, "4,000 years seems a bit exaggerated. I've had mornings like that." But did your vomit fold space? That's what these entitled, pink whales do all day, floating around in amniotic fluid with their stubby t-rex arms stiffly outstretched: They're master origamists. I can still see these creatures clearly because I recall all the surreal imagery whose inexplicable, banal haunting is the hallmark of decent sci-fi (well, not entirely inexplicable, and not always decent--one doesn't need much of an imagination to explain how the Enterprise's shapely hull and ample nacelles compel as surely as a hot dog), and I recall the silly dialog, but I do not recall any of it adding up to anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Hey!” 16-year-old me rebuts, “there’s a story!” Sure. I’ll recount it: Ambitious boy wants to impress father. Family goes on an adventure to this crazy-dry place (researching it on his 102nd-century iPad, the boy recites, with some concentration, “Arrakis. Dune. Desert planet,” and we wonder how a script of such breathtaking efficiency managed to fit so little in over two hours). There father and son make mega bank off of, err, spice (sound familiar?). Father’s fat, gross, homo, evil nemesis attacks. Father dies. Precocious boy finds way of impressing dead father by going Lawrence of Arabia on Father’s nemesis’ fat ass. Unlike Lawrence, boy is not crazy, and really is messiah. Montages of training his native army and blowing shit up. Together, boy, Patrick Stewart, and army of white Taoist Arabs storm the evil palace by shouting at it (the palace offers that much resistance). And how can this be? For he is the Kwisatz Haderach! (Which is what? The most apparent--and aggravating--explanation offered is that “there is a place terrifying to us--to women--that we dare not go.” Gosh, thank god our hero dares to!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no contingency in this series of events. Never are we led to believe that something else could happen. We never think "oh no! What if they fall off the back of that huge sandworm they're riding, and the whole evil palace takedown is a bust?" Well, okay, I did think that (man, riding sandworms looks precarious), but I never actually doubted that they would triumph. Which makes it not much of a triumph. Things just happen. Movies that seem to go on without me are not, it turns out, what thrill me, but rather movies that seem to play with my expectations, to be engaging with me, or--just as good if not better--manipulating me. Engagement with "Dune" is entirely unnecessary, because it doesn’t make the story any more interesting. Which is an odd coincidence, because intense, focused engagement appears to be the protagonist’s only attitude toward the world. It’s this universe’s whole shtick, really: the discipline of the mind. That’s why we’re always hearing everyone’s thoughts in voice-over, in imitation of the book’s endless italics. These are not, however, the thoughts of people engaged with any aspect of the world. For people allegedly possessed of precognition, they sound profoundly dimwitted. Often they just narrate what’s going on in the movie, because someone rightly guessed it would be too incoherent otherwise. At one point the boy and his mother are tied up in the back of an evil black hovercraft. His mother is gagged, because, playing out the misogynistic fears of men everywhere, their captors are afraid her voice will trick them. She’s a witch! Burn her! (I told you "The Holy Grail" could not be purged.) So, little omnisex god that he is, the boy decides to trick them with &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; witchy, reverbed voice. “He’s trying the voice!” we hear her think. Whoa now. Let’s not get too hasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the characters' voluble thoughts aren’t stating the obvious, they're super-suspicious. Meeting someone new, the future messiah thinks “he’s hiding something.” Following a scene during which he stares at this someone intently, he astutely deduces “he's hiding many things.” He reminds me of myself at my worst, convinced that if I just look at someone hard enough, I will suddenly understand them whole. It’s as if the movie is full of Watsons--all aspiring to be Sherlocks, all falling short. However, rather than this condition of amateurism leaving them with an erotic longing for the real thing, they are all satisfied with their dead-end observations. Maybe when humanity expunged computers from the universe, Twitter took up permanent residence in their thoughts. On that note, snark seems to have gone the same way as the internet, leaving us with ingenuousness the likes of which God has never seen, and an interrogative that I suspect is directed through the fourth wall: “I have NO FEELINGS!! Why?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this awarenessless awareness is what this movie has afflicted me with. I parrot its absurd, hyperbolic lines with as much mindfulness as a meme. Lynch and those other people involved in the movie (whom fans decry, as if waiting on the horizon of this movie is his untainted masterpiece) have unintentionally created a movie for postmodernist intellectuals to masturbate about: It obviates narrative entirely, leaving oddly memorable bits of speech to float without context and work their insidious way meaninglessly into the audience. Speaking of which, oh, fuck it, here you go:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I will kill you!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I will bend like a reed in the wind.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Not in the mood? Mood is a thing for cattle, and loveplay, not fighting!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I, Baron Vladimir Harkonnan, will encompass their doom!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Tell me of your homeworld, usul.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Stop your speaking!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Give me spice!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“They tried and failed?”&lt;br /&gt;“No, they tried and died!”</content><link rel='related' href='http://sweatingdark.blogspot.com/2012/02/dune.html' title='Dune'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6923305942774244505/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/02/dune_9627.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6923305942774244505'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6923305942774244505'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/02/dune_9627.html' title='Dune'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-6753626703947280377</id><published>2012-02-19T04:00:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T15:31:49.679-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Freezing in the Glow with Laptop'/><title type='text'>Dune</title><content type='html'>Let me tell you about something remarkable. Yes, that’s right, a movie so impressed me that I’m dying to tell you about it. I’m positively giddy. How couldn’t I be? It’s the worst movie ever, and I’ve watched it somewhere in the realm of a dozen times (but I’ve lost count). For me it’s one of those adolescent artifacts that nobody ever told you was going to stubbornly stick with you like pencil lead under the skin, or that tiny red spot under my right [left?] eye. Actually, they’re like neither of those things, because the culture you haplessly consume in teenagerdom is infectious, ever aspiring to bring everyone else down to its level. For this reason I never stop quoting The Simpsons, or--ugh--Monty Python and the Holy Grail.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, not every thing you gobble up back then will come back tasting of disease. For instance, The Far Side has been indelibly seared into my memory. I remember one strip quite clearly, in which two crocodiles are laying, distended bellies up, on a beach. In a smashed-up boat, the empty clothing and effects of two humans are at their feet. One crocodile says to the other: “wow, that was incrdible--pink, soft all the way through, no bones, or nothin’.” Which is a perfect description of the movie in question, “Dune”.&lt;br /&gt;It really is somewhat an achievement, a movie this long without the slightest hint of tension or, really, even a coherent plot. It is pure atmosphere--hazy, ridiculous, David Lynchian atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve heard that the Frank Herbert book on which this Homerically-long film is ostensibly based is full of intricately-plotted intrigue. Way back when, I read that book, but honestly I don’t remember a whit of it. The trouble was probably either that I was too in on Herbert’s version of zen, or that I, like David Lynch, was reading only for atmosphere. Maybe he too read it ensconced in a canyon crevice in Utah, soaking up Desertness and the most stiltedly philosophical navel-gazers you’ve ever met. Of course I was--they were just as bad as me. Okay, I take it back, I guess I remember something. In any case, all the film can remember of the complex politics (if there ever were any) is one line: “I see plans within plans.”&lt;br /&gt;Personally, all I see is the fascinatingly vaginal monster mouth that utters this--a drooping, undulating thing that in all other parts of the film spews orange light at planets. Apparently, this is the effect of, as the voice-over informs us at the beginning, being mutated over a period of 4,000 years. I’d believe that radiation victims have to take shits this bad, but do they fold space? The trouble is, I can recall all the surreal imagery whose inexplicable, banal haunting is the hallmark of decent sci-fi, and I can recall the hyperbolic dialogue (wait ‘til we get to Sting), none of it adds up to anything.&lt;br /&gt;“Hey!” you, the 16-year-old version of me, rebuts, “there’s a story!” Sure. I’ll recount it: Ambitious boy wants to impress father. They go on an adventure to this crazy-dry place (researching it on his 102nd-century iPad, the boy recites with some concentration “Arrakis. Dune. Desert planet,” and we wonder how a script of such efficiency managed to fit so little in over two hours), where they make mega bank off of, err, “spice” (sound familiar?). Father dies. Father’s fat, gross, evil, homo nemesis attacks. Precocious boy finds way of impressing dead father by going Lawrence of Arabia on Father’s nemesis’ fat ass. Unlike Lawrence, boy is not crazy, and really is the messiah. Montages of training his native army and blowing shit up. Patrick Stewart, in probably the most embarrassing moment of his career (although he’s had no shortage of them), says, almost incomprehensibly “you young pup! You young pup!” to boy. At least I think that’s what he says. Anyway, together boy, Patrick Stewart, and army of white Taoist Arabs storm the evil palace by shouting at it (and the palace offers about as much resistance). And how can this be? For he is the quizatch-hadderach! (Which is what? The most apparent--and aggravating--explanation is that “there is a place terrifying to us--to women--that we dare not go.” Thank god our hero can!)&lt;br /&gt;There is no contingency in this series of events.

This one allowed comments. I have to admit that the predictably resulting sea of inanity determined my viewing to an alarming degree. I kept finding myself helplessly arguing with the comments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone had commented “might as well jst watch part two of the film thats wen it starts to getin intresting.” So I eagerly awaited the second half of the movie, in part because as in all movies with a potential catastrophe, I wanted it to happen. As the planet Melancholia approached, I was filled with a mixture of dread and anticipation--a split melodramatically explored through the movie’s characters. When Part Two rolled around, it didn’t live up to the commenter’s contention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part One is a massive failure of a wedding reception; Part Two follows the bride's deep depression and her sister taking care of her. Watching Kristen Dunst’s transformation in the first part from ostensible happiness to agitated depression is more interesting than her journey to destruction in the second part. Perhaps this is because the former feels like consciousness brewing. This is something one prays for after the first non-slow-motion scene in which bride and groom try to maneauver the limo up the country road’s tight curve. For all of their post-marital giddiness and good humor, it is deliciously awkward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone else commented that “this movie will haunt you for days or weeks.” Despite how exasperatingly heavy-handed it is at times, this seems true. It’s only been a day, but it’s hard to purge the image of the giant watery world crashing into our own. What are more memorable, though, are the violently honest outbursts. This is why I enjoyed Part One so thoroughly: The way the wedding reception falls apart is as delightful as it is uncomfortable. The best nasty shards of speech come from the bride Justine’s mother, Gaby (Charlotte Rampling, who has unfortunately limited screen time). At the beginning of the reception there’s a round of obligatory speeches. Gaby stands when she becomes too fed up with Justine's father (John Hurt) and can't keep quiet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don’t believe in weddings,” she announces. “I just have one thing to say: enjoy it while it lasts.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's the most unnecessary speech ever, and pointlessly mean. I was charmed to the bone. Her other daughter, Claire, asks her "why did you even bother coming?" When it comes time to cut the cake and Gaby and Justine are missing, Claire's husband John gallantly (not really, he’s just pissed--they’re wasting his precious money he spent on the wedding, which he has so little of) goes up to fetch them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Gaby,” he says politely at the door to her bathroom, “I’m sorry to disturb you, but it’s time to cut the cake.” Which is a sitting duck of a sentence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I wasn’t there when Justine took her first crap on the potty. I wasn't there when she had her first sexual intercourse. So give me a break &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; from your fucking rituals.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was an even more enjoyably spectacular lack of caring than Justine suddenly pushing a stranger to the ground and fucking him on the eighteen-hole golf course (&lt;em&gt;eighteen&lt;/em&gt;, John keeps reminding everyone) that surrounds the mansion, merely because he happened to be there, or her subsequent monologue to her boss: “I hate you and your firm so deeply I couldn’t find the words to describe it. You are a despicable, power-hungry little man, Jack.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stranger was hired by Justine's boss to extract a tag line from her (she works in advertising). He proposes to her at the end of the night, and calls the sex they had "good" ("mechanical" would be accurate).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another comment read: "Brilliant ending. Left me breathless." I thought this meant there was a twist. So I kept expecting that despite all indications to the contrary, including the beginning in which we see Melancholia crash into Earth, that the planet would pass them by anyway. But maybe they'd all kill themselves before that happened, and we could all laugh drily at the cruel irony. The trouble is that from Part One to Part Two, harsh bemusement gives way to fantastical brutality. This is true, too, of the utterances of the melancholic. Justine's black outlook expands from the personal (for example asking her husband "what did you expect?" when he tells her the wedding and their relationship could have gone differently) to the cosmic: "Life on earth is evil. Nobody will miss us." In the same scene she pronounces that she knows we're alone in the universe because "I know things." Deadly seriousness sounds silly, and the consciousness that melancholy has brought sounds like delusion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the commenters on this website have a tendency to laud the movie's profundity if they're not telling us how boring it is, the blatantly metaphoric register that might pass for profundity gets tiresome quickly. By the third time someone repeated that Melancholia (the planet) was “hidden behind the sun,” I wanted it to crash into them, already. Yes, we get it. The planet is called Melancholia, for fuck’s sake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the grand metaphors often induced snickers ("it [Melancholia] looks friendly," Claire says wistfully, or how about the "Melancholia and the Dance of Death" diagram that Claire finds on the internet, showing how the planet will pass Earth and then turn around again and crash into it after all), the latter half the movie did terrify me. This is no doubt in part because I was watching it after midnight, and because the previous night I had been kept awake by a mysterious buzzing. It returned at irregular intervals, rattling the window like a subwoofer. Just when I thought it would go away, it came back. In the late hours with no one else to hear it, the unidentified noise gave me similarly apocalyptic feelings as the roaring of Melancholia as it grazes Earth's atmophere. As annoying as Claire is (of course, who isn't in this movie), I sympathized with her complete panic at the prospect of not just dying, but of the whole planet dying. It's the most radical aloneness possible. But Justine knows, I imagine, that we're just as alone already from the day we're born. Because she uh, knows things. The fact that I doubt her knowledge means, I suppose, that I'm attached to life. Or maybe that I'm not as much of an exhibitionist as Lars von Trier.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://sweatingdark.blogspot.com/2012/02/melancholia.html' title='Melancholia'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6749005645811060145/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/02/melancholia_5121.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6749005645811060145'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6749005645811060145'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/02/melancholia_5121.html' title='Melancholia'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8238001995797298300</id><published>2012-02-07T14:21:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.442-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Chocolate Cake</title><content type='html'>He unwrapped the squatting piece of black cake with an antiquated kind of possessive finesse.

He did not need conversation and never had. Reciprocity never having been available to him, he simply imbued others with what he needed.

Thus the cake was doubly his, and he offered another slice of it to his necessarily diplomatic companion, who declined, and who was in fact disgusted by the cake.

Actually it wasn't really a description--just "some kind of orange mousse, served prettily in half-orange skins". This could only be the playing out of a fad for food in shells of fruit, something which brings irrational terror to my restrictive post-1960s sensibilities. Being a mousse, it was probably made with gelatin, again a capital crime. But for whatever reason the idea of orange-flavored, um, pudding (let's stay away from the word mousse), appealed strongly. I talked about making it for ages. I hadn't really worked out how. As usual, I'd just wing it. Pretty much the only way I get my jollies cooking anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Christmas I decided to make to bring to dinner at a friend's house. The timing and setting completed my fantasy. As for the actual method, I decided to go with a "pure" approach that in my mind had the advantage of enriching the orange color of the orange: it would be thickened with egg yolks. Perfect. A pudding made of orange juice, orange zest, sugar, a bit of cinnamon, and egg yolks. All I needed to do was mix it all together,and heat it slowly while whisking in paranoia. In my mind this would create something like lemon curd, but orange. It didn't. It was sweet, dully flavored orange soup. Well, okay, I thought, I won't use gelatin, but I will use cornstarch. Like Lemon-meringue pie. I mixed in more and more until it seemed almost as thick as I wanted it. It had to stay inside half an orange without spilling, after all. Everything was ready, and though I wasn't entirely pleased with the result, at least it would be presentable. Then the goop cooled. The starch became a white crust on top. Below that it had turned to a dusty texture. Apparently I had mixed in so much starch that it could not all be dissolved in water, and had precipitated in protest. Rather than going to the dinner with me, it went into the garbage. There was no use pretending it was something it wasn't--namely, edible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Actually, it didn't go immediately into the trash. I didn't serve it to anybody, but I left the dozen filled orange halves sitting on the counter for several days, waiting for myself to decide they were alright.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More recently I actually made what I was modelling the orange goop on: lemon-meringue pie. My father had brought home a sizable box of Meyer lemons, and this was the best thing I could think of to do with them. It wasn't quite lemon-meringue&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;pie&lt;/em&gt;. My brother is allergic to wheat, so the crust was out. I didn't want to bother making wheat-free crust, and the lazy oats-butter-sugar crust I sometimes make for pumpkin pie seemed like a disgusting pairing for lemon. So it would simply be lemon-meringue: lemon filling below meringue. My brother and I have done this many times before, usually with tangelos instead of lemons. It turned out well. Except that faint flavor and texture. It was aggravatingly hardly noticable, but unmistakable. Cornstarch. It was the thing that one didn't want to taste with lemon. It broke the fantasy of confectionary abstraction. One does not want to taste the construction of one's dessert any more than one wants to see a trash heap in the middle of the city or watch a bird's neck chopped every time one takes a bite of chicken. Food, especially dessert, is not about transparency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate cornstarch.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/01/cornstarch.html' title='Cornstarch'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/319991524022525757/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/01/cornstarch.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/319991524022525757'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/319991524022525757'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/01/cornstarch.html' title='Cornstarch'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RB8yYltOO7I/TyX0BRNr7JI/AAAAAAAAECI/oGZSID3CBLY/s72-c/IMG_1041.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-3179978752338577439</id><published>2012-01-25T02:19:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T15:30:10.441-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>Haywire</title><content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;People talk about "desensitization". During the first half of "Haywire", I re-experienced it all again. Not so much because the movie manipulates you for a minute into thinking it's not an action movie, but because the violence is, well, violent. It's the directorial style that kills. Action has been revitalized by evacuating the musical score, and with the coreographing of accidence. Breathlessly you hear the sounds of struggle. Fights look and sound painful and awkward. It's all premeditated to be shockingly live. Soon you realize that what is shocking is also funny, and the movie becomes a deadpan slapstick. But it took me some time to get in on the joke. I was just a little horrified, uncertain of what I had gotten myself into. Did I really want to hear bones breaking?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I came in the movie had already started, but when I met Mallory (Gina Carano), she was sitting in a diner with lank black hair looking emo in the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo way. The scene plays on an unspoken assumption that the man who sits down across from her has in some way to do with a love plot. It seems to have gone wrong, and the man is only a messenger for another man. "He just wants you to come back and meet him," he says. "Do you know what he did?" she asks, with enough anger that it seems safe to assume terrible things. "You're not getting in the car, are you?" he says, and gets up. Then he punches her. Someone behind me says "in front of all those people?" as everyone in the diner stares in shock at them. As the fight escalates, they fling each other's bodies through various fragile objects throughout the diner, and she brutalizes him within and inch of his life, it becomes apparant that this is not the story of a victim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At some point I gave into the oddly gleeful panache of these action sequences. The pleasure of watching her hijinks reaches a pinnacle when, running from the police, she mounts a stairwell with an umbrella in one hand, and with the other calmly grabs any and every object and throwing it down the stairwell for her persuers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could appload some of the ways this movie created a female action hero, but really, that would be to ignore the hero. (Which you could speculate is what her father would do were she not an action hero.) Its lightly Scottish villain, Ewan McGregor, puts it succinctly through slimy teeth: "oh no, I wouldn't think of her as a woman. That would be a mistake." Personally, after the debacle of 'The Iron Lady' and its insistence upon hysteria, I'm happy to simply enjoy the wit and pluck of her martial prowess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, the movie won't allow us to ungender her. The camera caresses her. When--whatever, I can't remember the character's names--McGregor comes to her with the job of playing Michael Fassbender's date, she's pissed at what the camera does. "You want me to be eye-candy?!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McGregor pleads that it's just this once. She concedes. As if the film crew's microphone is a bug, when Fassbender meets her he says "my better half. Lovely to see you," and they kiss briefly, in a perfectly reserved way. This is the stuff of spies, the paranoia running so deep that apparently he's convinced everyone is watching them right then and there. But there's no filmic hint of anyone--no camera angles from across the street, no rushed shots of strangers eyeing them from behind newspapers. So we are made to wonder at the levels of acting, what each is getting out of this, and whom is playing whom. It is, in short, a romance, without the romance. Much like another movie Steven Soderbergh directed, "Out of Sight". But there is not a hint of sweetness here as in that movie, and this short romance ends in betrayl. Which is expected. While he's in the shower she sets up his phone to be GPS-tracked by hers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he tries to kill her, she kills him by shooting him in the head. The choreography, grappling its way through their hotel room, seems calculated to suggest sexual struggle. They fight their way onto the bed, and she traps his head between her thighs, strangling him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of strangling in this movie. The fights are wonderfully awkward, won not by spectacular moves, but pure tenacity. She slams her adversaries against walls while they grab hold of her. She chokes them from behind. She throws things at them. She hits them repeatedly in the vital organs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when you think she's really slick, she fucks up just a little. Scrambling her way around Dublin rooftops, she's slips and falls on her back. She limps on toward victory, of course. In another mishap, successfully having backed her way out of reach of, as she calls them, LEOs, she runs smack into a deer. "There's a deer in the car," the innocent civillian whose car she's, err, borrowed, says. There's always a deer in the car, so to speak, or about to be. It's how this world works. &amp;nbsp;But things never go truely haywire. Sure, the villain of sleazy villains (Antonio Banderas) is shocked enough by his fate to utter "oh shit" (she shows up on his balcony) before the credits roll, but she gets him. Bad luck switches sides.</content><link rel='related' href='http://sweatingdark.blogspot.com/2012/01/haywire.html' title='Haywire'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3179978752338577439'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3179978752338577439'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.importType' value='IMPORTED_DRAFT'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-734436877708821990</id><published>2012-01-19T14:12:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.424-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>The Appetite of Sarah Lund</title><content type='html'>Lately I've been watching "The Killing" ("Forbrydelsen"). Once you start it is difficult to stop. Sometimes, you forget to eat--not unlike its detective protagonist, Sarah Lund. She survives on whatever is at hand, unless it is offered by someone she does not want to show weakness to. When she returns, usually late at night, to her mother's house where she lives, she rummages like a teenager for whatever. Having largely starved herself most of the day, this is her ad-hoc feast. She does not intentionally starve herself; she gorges herself on the sustenance of the investigation and forgets that anyone, much less herself, has other needs. But it is not the investigative nature of her work which feeds her, per se. Her son tells her peevishly "you only care about dead people," but that's not quite it. My projections lead me to believe simply that investigating the case is certain to give her something back--something cold, like most things she wolfs down in a hurry, but abundant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both her and her unwanted partner, Jan Meyer, live on an edge of anxious attachment to their work. Every lead leads to another, and each promises to crack the case. Thus the investigation can never be let alone, and they can never quite rest. They must keep prodding it. At one point it is their boss pushing them, but a new boss then pushes them to be patient and keep things quiet. It becomes clear that it is not outside pressure that makes them, especially Lund, unable to stop. The case will be fine, but if she stops, &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;loses hold. The lid of her life would fling open. On the one hand the investigation drives her toward destruction, on the other hand it is a holding pattern. The latter is how her plain obsession is pleasurable in a "Rear Window" way: she puts herself on ice and watches the world around her aflame. She is subject; everyone else is object. Paradoxically, this makes her just as vulnerable as everyone under her detective's gaze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This all-consuming purpose is not so much fed as kept going by a constant stream of coffee poured from vacuum-carafes into small white cups (not quite demitasses and not quite mugs), and in her partner's case, cigarettes. This is not coffee taken to jar oneself awake, but to further engorge already electrified (yet exhausted) neurons. It is drunk to make easier ongoing activity, not as a promise of activity to come. Her partner, being more ill at ease with all this, smokes. It doesn't help with the anxiety, clearly, but it gives him something to reach for. When Lund is kicked off the case, there is a turning point: She smokes one of his cigarettes. Soon she smokes another, and casually hands the half-smoked cigarette to him. Notably, they are standing behind glass side by side, looking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two detectives' eating habits markedly differ. He is abject through his food; his agitation spills out with the cheese crisps, chips, and bananas he desperately gnashes. These snacks, like his cigarettes, leave a great deal of refuse: crumbs, peels, ashes. Lund does not share this habit. In fact, it annoys her. Once he calls her, and the whole time he speaks he is crunching cheese crisps noisily. "Stop it with the cheese crisps for a minute!" she snaps. He does not. When she hangs up he's tilting the dregs of the bag into his mouth. Lund, by contrast, is a creature of control. She eats, as I said, when it is convenient, and when it does not mess up her persona. What she eats is never messy, but that is not to say she eats well-manneredly. Sometimes she doesn't have to, because she eats alone. One time it's a pot of unidentified brown glop that she eats directly from the pot with a spoon, in front of her computer. Early in the show she comes home and serves herself a plate of what looks to be leftover mashed potatoes and gravy. She is clearly hungry, yet she eats it disinterestedly. It is merely something to go into her gullet, offering no psychological comfort, only calories. She looks up at her mother, which is rare, and, conciliatory, says "this is good."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does she survive on besides her mother's leftovers snatched at odd hours? Bread and butter in the office. Her and Meyer slather untoasted slices of bread with butter, and munch them hungrily while irritably carrying on a discussion about the case, and drinking coffee. As I'm sure some of you figured, I find this appealing. This is the kind of breakfast (whenever it happens to be taken) that does not sully its consumer with the baseness of food. You can eat it without admitting that you need. You surf along like this, not acknowledging the wave moving to crash over you.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2012/01/appetite-of-sarah-lund.html' title='The Appetite of Sarah Lund'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/734436877708821990/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/01/the-appetite-of-sarah-lund.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/734436877708821990'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/734436877708821990'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/01/the-appetite-of-sarah-lund.html' title='The Appetite of Sarah Lund'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-7059846734400908988</id><published>2012-01-15T17:33:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T15:39:03.444-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>The Iron Lady</title><content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine was excited to see "The Iron Lady" because she admires Margaret Thatcher. My friend does not so much admire her policies, but rather the way she made her way in a government of men. My friend points out that people are usually unable to&amp;nbsp;separate&amp;nbsp;her politics from her sex. In all of this movie's cold pity, it also fails to do anything but reify an unexamined impression. Here her political decisions are not decisions, but the&amp;nbsp;collateral&amp;nbsp;damage of a psyche that demanded of its bearer to, as my brother says of Hilary Clinton, have a bigger penis than the men. (His view of Clinton as a woman so obsessed with one-upping male politicians that she ends up more monstrous is this script's view of Thatcher.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie's crude psychoanalysis of Margaret starts early. Giggled at by girls her age (literally there is a scene in which they walk by her father's shop, glancing over at her and giggling as if we're in Constance and Margaret has just received a damning blast), teenaged Margaret becomes entrenched. After all, although nobody else does, her father loves her more for her ungirlish ambition. When she is accepted to Oxford, her father warmly congratulates her. Her mother, washing the dishes, says that her hands are still wet. She doesn't bother to dry them, turns back to the dishes, and the script has suddenly explained Margaret's life. Before Margaret agrees to become Thatcher she sums up her need to not become a housewife by telling her future husband "I do not want to die washing a teacup." (She does not, but there is one drawn out scene of her washing a teacup as a widow, during which I half expected her to keel over from the force of the movie's need for poetic resonance.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the movie the lack of her mother's love is reiterated. She is shown hating every other woman who walks on screen. She ignores her daughter and swoons over her son. "I always have preferred the company of men."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most egregious scene is in a meeting of the cabinet. She explodes at the president for a typo in the agenda. The men silently gape at her raving. The scene keeps cutting away to shots of her looking malevolently at the ceiling. Someone in the audience asked "is this real?" (The alternative being that it's in her head, like her dead husband.) Wrenching her body, she finally wails "you're all so weak! So weak." The body language of her outburst is about as subtle as a silent film. I would not have been surprised had she begun skulking around the government halls like an animal, hunched over, fingers clawed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she sends Britain off to get back the Falkland Islands, she has ceased being depicted as a person, and we are now only allowed to see madness. Why does she decide to go into the Falklands when, as the President (played by Anthony Head) tells her, the country can't afford it? Penis-envy gone wild, obviously. Cynicism about people's motives in politics is usually a gas, but this is lazy. The movie may as well have been titled "The Crazy Bitch". The effort to show her humanity has deprived her of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I'm to watch an unyielding woman hell-bent on securing power at whatever cost, how about one who is judged insane by the other characters, not by the screenwriter. In other words, give me Patty Hewes in "Damages," not some old bullshit of a case-study served up as Margaret Thatcher.</content><link rel='related' href='http://sweatingdark.blogspot.com/2012/01/iron-lady.html' title='The Iron Lady'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/7059846734400908988/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/01/the-iron-lady_4416.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7059846734400908988'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7059846734400908988'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/01/the-iron-lady_4416.html' title='The Iron Lady'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-579413390188976739</id><published>2012-01-10T15:16:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T15:39:03.437-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy</title><content type='html'>I went into "Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy" with a humorless mood. This was embarrassing because it was sure to share my grim view. On my way out the door, my brother read me this quip from &lt;a href="http://www.toronto.com/article/707624--review-mission-impossible-4-vs-tinker-tailor-soldier-spy"&gt;a review&lt;/a&gt;: "it’s a movie of chain smokers and whisperers, of grey skies and glum expressions, of rattling tea cups and rotary-dialed telephones," which once inside the theater gave me an uncomfortable sense of being in colusion with the movie. I was glum; it was glum. In an absurd flight of self-consciousness I imagined others rolling their eyes at me for taking this terribly serious movie so seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's so serious that even a little relief had the audience in stitches. Smiley, the retired spy who is investigating his former peers (because he has hero fantasies or because he's power hungry, take your pick) goes to talk to a woman who no longer works at The Circus, as they call the intelligence agency. It is implied that they were once romantically involved. They sit down to tea, and have a view into the kitchen where youths make out on the counter and then go upstairs. She says "I don't know about you George, but I'm feeling seriously under-fucked!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George is not to be seen doing anything dirty, so that when we see him at the top of the Circus at the end of the movie, it's supposed to be like a coronation of the righteous king. The film dryly observes just as its spies do, so that this final &amp;nbsp;cut feels as if it, too, is under scrutiny. But there's nothing behind this habitual scrutiny. The spies in this movie analyze but are not insightful, are observant but not thoughtful. One could read the camera the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give everything away, when the villain is slain, it is Colin Firth. He's shot through cleanly the cheek. The gore in this film is gratuitious, but not in the campy way. It's not fireworks in slimy red for us to marvel at, but quick and terrible. This must be a singular moment in his career, getting shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rising stars, on the other hand, get another sort of glamor. I'm convinced that Benedict Cumberbach's agent insists that he wear fabulous clothes ever since the success of "Sherlock" and its resulting coat and scarf sales. As Peter he's the peacock in the Circus, strutting about in his bright blue tie and handkerchief, doing Smiley's bidding. Who, in contrast, insists upon a protective shell of drab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a kind of defensive criticism in which one faults the movie for the parts one didn't understand in it. Did you understand all the dialogue in this movie? Honestly I didn't understand what was going on half the time. The music swelled menacingly and I thought "um, what are you driving at?" It's a good device to put the audience in the position of an imperfect observer, doling us out little facts as the story unfolds in both directions. But sometimes it seemed as if we were expected to have already read Le Carre's book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I found the only fun reading of this movie was as a psychodrama of purification. The corrupt Circus, who gives information to its professed enemy, is the mess of the psyche's attachments. Smiley, somehow standing outside of this is here to perform a superegoical audit. In the end the Circus is reconnected with itself, restored as, well, an agency. Its will will once again be carried out without turning against itself. In parallel to this is the purification of Smiley's marriage. Anne, who we never see, is a contested posession between Smiley and Bill Haydon (Colin Firth). "It was nothing personal, I hope you understand," Haydon tells Smiley, "I knew that if you saw me as Anne's lover, you couldn't see me straight on. It worked, up to a point." Apparently Smiley is the perfect spy, able to overcome the compromises that emotions allegedly wreak on objectivity. In the end he and his wife are reunited. Through a doorway we see him gently touching her shoulder. Order is restored; the scapegoat for the two mirroring plotlines is one person, and he is punished. Hooray.</content><link rel='related' href='http://sweatingdark.blogspot.com/2012/01/tinker-taylor-soldier-spy.html' title='Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/579413390188976739/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/01/tinker-taylor-soldier-spy_6215.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/579413390188976739'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/579413390188976739'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/01/tinker-taylor-soldier-spy_6215.html' title='Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-2194449219975934479</id><published>2012-01-01T17:41:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T15:39:03.404-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sweating in the Dark with Geriatrics'/><title type='text'>Young Adult</title><content type='html'>What I should not do is review this movie. (Or any movie, really, but that’s another matter.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This town is small enough that one of the audience came to the same coffee shop afterwards. “it’s not about a young adult writer,” she was saying emphatically to the barista, who was I suppose curious or pretending to be for the sake of small talk. It is about a young adult writer, but I was caught in the same identification that she was. “It’s not just high school” she said, eyes widening in confidence, “people--young people--really do get stuck like that, and they’re not psychotic.” Neither is Theron, despite the absurd character, Mavis, she is supposed to be playing. She knows better, but she does it all anyway: chases after her high school sweetheart, keeps but only loves her fluffy, purse-sized dog as much as she loves him, and drinks coca-cola every morning. It's supposed to be darkly funny, deadpan, but is instead depressingly real to people like me, and, apparently, someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagined a crisis of imagination leading to this script. The author (”author,” Mavis always corrects anyone who calls her a “writer”) can’t write, as her protagonist cannot in the beginning. Fed up, the author decides to not filter anything, to do the authorial “fuck it” that her protagonist does with life. She sends Mavis off to do the least imaginitive thing possible, for her: get her high school boyfriend back. This is the author’s bare imaginitive act, while the rest is filled in with unhappy vignettes of mundanity: sending the dog out to feed from a plastic container that she never cleans up from the balcony (the camera shows us a pile), not connecting with but cynically sleeping with her date anyway, playing the same tired song on her mix tape over and over as she drives to her home town (which is tiresomely metaphoric). What was startling to me was the misery of interstate travel through small towns. Shot after shot of off-ramp chain eateries, mostly empty parking lots. This sort of imaginationlessness that Ashland, with its relative wealth, has relegated to the edges of town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’ve lived here all my life,” I told her, “but then I don’t hate Ashland as much as she does Mercury.” Ashland sucks less than Mercury. It’s more bearable, and complicates the upward mobility narrative blackly played out in this movie. Even the terribly cruel and self-loathing probably wouldn’t say that only nothings live here, as one tragic and ignored character does to our blonde heroine. What I said to the other moviegoer was that there seem to be two endings: the conventional ending in which everything is wrapped up in the last ten minutes: She decides, somewhat bewilderingly, to move on with her life. She gets into her broken car, eyes sunken with makeup meant to amplify a lack of makeup, but changed for the better. What this neat ending doesn't deal with is what I called the other ending, but it's not really an ending: After sleeping with the self-described "fat geek," she comes upstairs in her wine-stained getup and sits at the kitchen table with his sister, who idolizes her. The sister gives her a pep talk that consists of Mavis being better than everyone in Mercury. She, after all, went to the city, and writes things. Everyone who lives in Mercury is meant to, because they are nothing. She eats this up, smiling, and is convinced to go back to Minneapolis. "Take me with you," the sister pleads. "You're good here, Sandra, you're good," Mavis says, and leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It figures that I would think that it’s too bad that the “having a life” option in this movie is marriage. The lifeless are single; the living are married with children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not the sort of movie during which you have to keep from peeing your pants because you laugh so hard. But then, thankfully, it was also not the sort of movie in which characters regularly pee their pants to make you laugh. The most it ever roused the audience to was a sharp chuckle. More often I breathed out loudly through my nose in that barely laugh that's like a whisper. We all began laughing because, I guess, we expected a comedy to be funny. At some point we stopped straining.</content><link rel='related' href='http://sweatingdark.blogspot.com/2012/01/young-adult.html' title='Young Adult'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/2194449219975934479/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/01/young-adult_9976.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2194449219975934479'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2194449219975934479'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/01/young-adult_9976.html' title='Young Adult'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8204141655792808745</id><published>2011-12-21T17:13:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.439-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>A Box of Persimmons</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QrYq6eimJNw/TuvaMjCe1WI/AAAAAAAAD4U/ng_pzx35mUU/s1600/IMG_1021.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QrYq6eimJNw/TuvaMjCe1WI/AAAAAAAAD4U/ng_pzx35mUU/s320/IMG_1021.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I was given a box of persimmons. There were a lot of unasked for and unexpected things that came with the box of persimmons, one of which was this: "they don't have much flavor." He was right. Smell, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were the tiny black specks buried in their flesh as if they had just come in barefoot from a particularly old deck. Actually, they looked more like insect eggs. So I entered "tiny black specks" into google, and came up only with several people complaining about black spots on the outside, on those forums where you ask a question and (hopefully) get a response. (I continue to remain wilfully ignorant of where this question-and-answer content comes from, because I can't imagine who would actually ask the questions. It's easy to imagine the answerers--The Internet has a major infestation of them.) Lacking a definitive answer after ten minutes of research (that is always the criterion), I convinced myself that the specks were nothing. (Nothing is amazing. I like to do a lot of it.) And if not that wonderful soldering iron to the brain of an idiom, then they were "precipitated tannins." I read that somewhere about overripe persimmons, which these are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was the bite into obcenity one yielded to me. It was the sweet part of my lunch. I was in a car. I chucked the wounded fruit into my teacup to save it for persimmon bread. I always make a gesture of saving everything: vegetable scraps, leftovers, half-full cans of coconut milk, thickened gravy. All of these things eventually rot in the fridge, except for the vegetable scraps (kept in the freezer), which I strangely enough do use for soup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was the indescribably monstrous texture of persimmon pie. No, not the kind that's made like apple pie--the kind that's made like pumpkin pie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TOa88y1hfJ8/TuvaMzr7oLI/AAAAAAAAD4Y/Mq53tMN9PXE/s1600/IMG_1022.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TOa88y1hfJ8/TuvaMzr7oLI/AAAAAAAAD4Y/Mq53tMN9PXE/s320/IMG_1022.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Before I disgust us both any more, let me assure you that persimmon bread was good. I made two loaves of it, and ate all of it. It too was as alien as befits a fruit named&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Diospyros&lt;/em&gt;: The bread browned unnaturaly quickly, so quickly I was afraid I would end up with a burnt exterior and a goopy interior. Once baked the upper half of the inside was lighter than the deep brown lower half. Why? As far as I'm concerned, persimmons are an unknowable function in persimmon bread, lending something you can't quite taste to the finished product. Yeah, okay, that's an overstatement. It changes the texture, and I could find out how by baking the same "bread" (i.e. cake) without the persimmons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7Wbo2Fvx5xU/TuvaPrbTY4I/AAAAAAAAD40/20ujAMgrqFU/s1600/IMG_1029.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7Wbo2Fvx5xU/TuvaPrbTY4I/AAAAAAAAD40/20ujAMgrqFU/s320/IMG_1029.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I would have another batch of persimmon bread, but my father threw them out. I can't say that it was a bad idea at all. Given the chance, I probably would have saved them until they were black piles of snot. It was taking me a long time to understand that although they were pretty, they were mostly flavorless, and going bad quickly. Here is what happened to the persimmons before ever being used: First, I left them in the car for most of a week. I was commuting in the car every day for four days. While I was working, everything else got forgotten about, including the persimmons. Then they sat on the kitchen table for two days, while I kept telling myself that I would turn them all into something baked. Finally, I used five of them in the persimmon bread. By this time many were turning a troubling umber shade, and some had large black spots (not problematic in themselves, but indicative of ripening), and some were rotting into the cardboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just those five persimmons made a lot of persimmon bread, which took a few days to eat. I probably would have gone on like that, in a charade of frugality, using every single last persimmon by making another batch of persimmon bread every three days. My father inadvertantly saved me from all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason those of us who can waste, waste so much: Along with the past-prime food, obsolesced technology, and high-maintenace cars, misery is thrown out. There are those, including myself, who romanticize not wasting. We would like to live in a world where everything has a place. Of course, there is another way out of misery, but it involves not only foresight, but also the impossible murder of the part of you that yields: don't accumulate anything you will waste.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/12/box-of-persimmons.html' title='A Box of Persimmons'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/8204141655792808745/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/12/a-box-of-persimmons.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8204141655792808745'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8204141655792808745'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/12/a-box-of-persimmons.html' title='A Box of Persimmons'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QrYq6eimJNw/TuvaMjCe1WI/AAAAAAAAD4U/ng_pzx35mUU/s72-c/IMG_1021.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-7872504810564399701</id><published>2011-11-09T19:11:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.430-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Green Hubbard Pie</title><content type='html'>Well, I finally got around to making pie with a Green Hubbard. Unfortunately, I forgot to take any photos. The Green Hubbard may or may not have tasted better in pie than Pie Pumpkin or Delicata. It was good. At some level one just needs some orange shit with the right texture to sweeten, add eggs to, and bake into a custard pie filling. I did get a hint of something disagreeable in the Green Hubbard's flavor. I don't know what, exactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--FLgBgtQMG4/TrsXodEpmmI/AAAAAAAAD1E/K5zYY3NNMnQ/s1600/IMG_1013.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--FLgBgtQMG4/TrsXodEpmmI/AAAAAAAAD1E/K5zYY3NNMnQ/s400/IMG_1013.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;Blogger fails at captioning, so the captions will just be text below the photo.&amp;nbsp;This lighting is shit, and the pie looks, if I do say so myself, unappetizing. It is, however, the finest squash pie I've ever made. Whether this is due to the variety of squash or some slight differences in ingredient proportions, I couldn't say. The texture was perfect. The next pair of pies I made from this same squash were much runnier, unfortunately, because coconut milk varies in thickness from can to can, apparently. Or maybe it doesn't really, and I just got a freakishly thick can the first time. Which is to say it does.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YnPv7TKgn90/TrsXkp9LRvI/AAAAAAAAD0w/PqWDsUM1bHY/s1600/IMG_1006.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YnPv7TKgn90/TrsXkp9LRvI/AAAAAAAAD0w/PqWDsUM1bHY/s320/IMG_1006.JPG" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YnPv7TKgn90/TrsXkp9LRvI/AAAAAAAAD0w/PqWDsUM1bHY/s1600/IMG_1006.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YnPv7TKgn90/TrsXkp9LRvI/AAAAAAAAD0w/PqWDsUM1bHY/s400/IMG_1006.JPG" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When uncertain of what pose to strike in a photo, go for the directional mouth-opening, indicating that you wish to eat the object your mouth is pointed at. Interestingly (the most pointless adjective ever), this is generally done to objects that you would not actually eat. The stagily gaping maws occupy a universe of never-realized fantasy (unless of course you're a cannibal).

The whole thing was thicker than cream. I keep telling myself that I use coconut milk for its fat content, but it really does add a somewhat jarring flavor. I've grown used to it, but honestly the only reason I keep doing it is because I'm afraid the pie will somehow not come out right if I use some other (non-dairy) liquid.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SXMDj05ia-Y/TrsXjepyC_I/AAAAAAAAD0g/BOHZbpQTl6s/s1600/IMG_0999.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SXMDj05ia-Y/TrsXjepyC_I/AAAAAAAAD0g/BOHZbpQTl6s/s400/IMG_0999.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;I outsourced the crust-mixing and crust-shaping to my lackies, who were quite willing because they were to receive pie in exchange for their labor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jlcwF88AzCg/TrsXjAa72mI/AAAAAAAAD0c/PZMwS7cygAw/s1600/IMG_0998.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jlcwF88AzCg/TrsXjAa72mI/AAAAAAAAD0c/PZMwS7cygAw/s400/IMG_0998.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;That's cinnamon, fresh nutmeg, allspice, cloves, and black pepper. I used to mix the whole pie in the food processor; these days I add a step by food processing the squash flesh, and then transferring it to a bowl in which I whisk the filling together.

Still here? Hmm.&amp;nbsp;Elbert Green Hubbard (June 19, 1856 – May 7, 1915) was an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; writer, publisher, artist, and philosopher. Raised in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson,_Illinois"&gt;Hudson, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, he met early success as a traveling salesman with the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larkin_Administration_Building"&gt;Larkin soap company&lt;/a&gt;. Today Hubbard is mostly known as the founder of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roycroft"&gt;Roycroft&lt;/a&gt; artisan community in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Aurora,_New_York"&gt;East Aurora, New York&lt;/a&gt;, an influential exponent of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_Movement"&gt;Arts and Crafts Movement&lt;/a&gt;. Among his many publications were the nine-volume work Little Journeys to the Homes of the Great and the short story &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Message_to_Garcia"&gt;A Message to Garcia&lt;/a&gt;. He and his second wife, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Moore_Hubbard"&gt;Alice Moore Hubbard&lt;/a&gt;, died aboard the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania"&gt;RMS Lusitania&lt;/a&gt;, which was sunk by a German submarine off the coast of Ireland on May 7, 1915.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-k8hmNRxnDt4/TrsXn6zowVI/AAAAAAAAD1A/2lRftqOTdNU/s1600/IMG_1012.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-k8hmNRxnDt4/TrsXn6zowVI/AAAAAAAAD1A/2lRftqOTdNU/s400/IMG_1012.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I really don't know how long to bake these for--I just keep checking them until they appear firm, and then poke them with a fork. The fork doesn't have to come out cleanly for it to be done (like cake), but it has to stick less, and have a consistency that isn't runny.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;115 days. &lt;i&gt;Cucurbita maxima&lt;/i&gt;. Plant produces good yields of 15" long dark bronze-green skinned squash. It has a very sweet orange-yellow thick flesh. Good for making pies. Keeps well into spring. Suitable for home garden and market growers. A heirloom winter squash variety dating back to 1790. This squash was likely used by your great-grandmother and is a fall tradition still today in New England. Finely-textured, yellow-orange flesh that is medium sweet and medium dry with a very hard rind. It is also suited for soups and all of your holiday baking needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-j2FF1wsQ2e8/TrsXnTS88MI/AAAAAAAAD08/Oaf_Ymo7Knw/s1600/IMG_1011.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-j2FF1wsQ2e8/TrsXnTS88MI/AAAAAAAAD08/Oaf_Ymo7Knw/s400/IMG_1011.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I meant to take more than one photo of these, but by the time I had remembered to take one, we had mostly eaten them. They're terribly addicting, as I suppose anything is that's salty and crunchy. The seeds of the Green Hubbard are especially fat, although in part that is due to the thickness of their germ.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SbxaeXN6n2Q/TrsXm0bczeI/AAAAAAAAD04/M0kCZtscdPY/s1600/IMG_1008.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SbxaeXN6n2Q/TrsXm0bczeI/AAAAAAAAD04/M0kCZtscdPY/s400/IMG_1008.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Look, I cleaned the stove. Don't worry, in another week it will be covered in crisp, half-burned, oil-soaked bits of unidentifiable food.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-li52_iUKvdk/TrsXmJmptTI/AAAAAAAAD00/THUbcEIzEqU/s1600/IMG_1007.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-li52_iUKvdk/TrsXmJmptTI/AAAAAAAAD00/THUbcEIzEqU/s400/IMG_1007.JPG" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I believe this is called a "smile," but it looks more like I'm just baring my teeth. Yup, it's true. black is the only real color. It's amazing how I have just about as much to go on regarding these photos as you do. I would like to tell you how it happened that my photo was taken, but I don't really remember. I do know _who_ took my photo, but because I'm determined to be a useless narrator, I won't tell you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Hubbard squash in my possession, &lt;a href="http://kblog.lunchboxbunch.com/2011/10/hubbard-pumpkin-pie.html"&gt;I&lt;/a&gt; knew &lt;a href="http://kblog.lunchboxbunch.com/2011/10/hubbard-pumpkin-pie.html"&gt;I&lt;/a&gt; had to make pie. This sweet Hubbard Pumpkin Pie contains minimalist ingredients, which allows you to experience the unique flavor and texture of this incredibly dense and silky squash variety. And the color from this squash is a brilliant golden amber with undertones of green and caramel. So pretty beforeand after you bake it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hubbard squash is said to have a mysterious origin, possibly named after a Mrs. Elizabeth Hubbard, who lived in the 1840s and gave seeds of the squash to friends, thus increasing its popularity. It is not known exactly where the hubbard was first grown, but most winter squash varieties are known to be New World foods, meaning they originated in the Americas. It can now be grown almost anywhere with enough sunlight, water, and warm weather; the seed is known to be quite resilient and grows best if planted during the spring to allowed to grow all summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--bGq4lDLtiA/TrsXj-J3qMI/AAAAAAAAD0o/hexujjMFF7c/s1600/IMG_1004.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--bGq4lDLtiA/TrsXj-J3qMI/AAAAAAAAD0o/hexujjMFF7c/s320/IMG_1004.JPG" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;More cinnamon.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My "Green Hubbard" is not the "True Green Hubbard" pictured &lt;a href="http://www.heritageharvestseed.com/squashmaxima.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It is not the original Hubbard squash that all other varieties of Hubbards were selected from. Nor is it imported from Australia in 1932, from seed secured from Arthur Yates and Co. of Sydney. If you are splashed by water make sure to splash back. If you fall deep into water you may fall through time as well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quisque eu fermentum urna.

Warted Sugar Marrow, Courge Brodee Galeuse, Giraumon Galeux d’Eysines) originated from the Bordeaux region of France. This heirloom was first listed by Vilmorin in 1883 under the name Warted Sugar Marrow. The salmon pink squash can weigh up to 15 pounds and are shaped like slightly flattened pumpkins. The most unique trait of this variety is the large beige warts that it develops as it ripens. The flesh can be used for soup or baked and the long vines are productive and early. Beautiful for fall decorations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many times the skin or rind will simply lift off with your fingers (see the photo at left) .  I'll bet you didn't realize making your own pumpkin glop... err, "puree" was this easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: there are many varieties of pumpkin and some make better pies that other (due to sugar content, flavor, texture and water content.  Drier, sweeter, fine-grained pies; the small (8" across) ones called "pie pumpkins" are best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your pumpkin puree has standing, free water, you may want to let it sit for 30 minutes and then pour off any free water.  That will help prevent you pie from being too watery! Beyond, that, I have not found that the water makes a difference - I wouldn't be TOO concerned about it!&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/11/green-hubbard-pie.html' title='Green Hubbard Pie'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/7872504810564399701/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/11/green-hubbard-pie.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7872504810564399701'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7872504810564399701'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/11/green-hubbard-pie.html' title='Green Hubbard Pie'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--FLgBgtQMG4/TrsXodEpmmI/AAAAAAAAD1E/K5zYY3NNMnQ/s72-c/IMG_1013.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4740819135245856146</id><published>2011-11-05T00:25:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.376-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>A Series of Attempts at a Post on Pie-Squashes</title><content type='html'>&lt;center&gt;~&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Several Attempts to Write a Post Comparing Squashes for Pie&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: -webkit-auto;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qvmmwSrFjFM/TrTgYv5PdwI/AAAAAAAADzg/BLIgcro96mI/s1600/IMG_0968.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qvmmwSrFjFM/TrTgYv5PdwI/AAAAAAAADzg/BLIgcro96mI/s200/IMG_0968.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Beware, it has Chipotle powder.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;It would be more ideal to write this comparison of pie-squashes after having tried the allegedly perfect variety, Blue Hubbard, but I can't get my hands on one. The squashes thrown indiscriminately into bins outside of the supermarkets in town never include Blue Hubbard. What I have tried will have to do, then, because let's be honest: By the time I find a Blue Hubbard, I won't want to write a comparison anyway. (At this point Blue Hubbard's inaccessibility has me elevating it to some kind of edible angel of pie-baking.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far this season I've tried Buttercup, Delicata, Pie Pumpkin and Golden Acorn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;~&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pumpkin Pie Round 2: Pie Pumpkin vs Golden Acorn&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Golden Acorn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yvD79qFuOOo/TrTfVnWEUXI/AAAAAAAADyg/6VLPrjuu4sY/s1600/IMG_0976.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yvD79qFuOOo/TrTfVnWEUXI/AAAAAAAADyg/6VLPrjuu4sY/s200/IMG_0976.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 cups cooked squash puree&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2/3 cup coconut milk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 eggs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup white sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2/3 cup brown sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pie Pumpkin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7kY4ME_gqWI/TrTghkbESmI/AAAAAAAADz4/tMcMaCTAlUc/s1600/IMG_0962.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7kY4ME_gqWI/TrTghkbESmI/AAAAAAAADz4/tMcMaCTAlUc/s200/IMG_0962.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 cups cooked pumpkin puree&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup coconut milk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 eggs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/3 cup white sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/3 cup brown sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons water&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-13lCNPL8uSM/TrTgjIMmJII/AAAAAAAADz8/JvJvXh9tcxs/s1600/IMG_0961.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-13lCNPL8uSM/TrTgjIMmJII/AAAAAAAADz8/JvJvXh9tcxs/s200/IMG_0961.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The Devourer of Small,&lt;br /&gt;Unsuspecting&amp;nbsp;Creature's&amp;nbsp;almond&lt;br /&gt;flour&amp;nbsp;gingersnap crust&amp;nbsp;(with&lt;br /&gt;molasses)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;This week I tried making two other varieties of squash into pie, Pie Pumpkin and Golden Acorn. Why Golden Acorn? Because, sorting through the squash bins at Shop 'N' Kart, its label read "delicious baked, microwaved or in a pie," and none of the others (Green Kuri, Kabocha, Acorn, Carnival, Delicata, Butternut, Buttercup) had anything about pie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;~&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let us return to the method I used to favor--asking inappropriately speculative questions of food (although the bananas turned me down) and walking far out onto the limb of looking too hard for profundity. What makes good pumpkin pie? To some it is something that doesn't look like a pumpkin at all, but by virtue of the versatility of the term may be called pumpkin, and comes in a can. To others the orange tone of the fruit's skin is proof of the pie. Still others care only for the pie's taste--whatever tastes best. But what is best? Are we searching for an ideal here, and every good taste is orbiting it? Or is taste as blind as it feels? I could tell you, for instance,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;~&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zDRmyMIgULY/TrTgXTJMpkI/AAAAAAAADzY/G7rWklDESKw/s1600/IMG_0970.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zDRmyMIgULY/TrTgXTJMpkI/AAAAAAAADzY/G7rWklDESKw/s200/IMG_0970.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;TDSUC's pie&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I found a Green Hubbard (apparently it's "Green" not "Blue" as I once thought), and have taken it home with me. Not that I was looking anymore, but there it was. They are rumored (by one website and by my brother who once made a pie from one he was given as a kind of payment) to be the ideal squash for pie. Therefore my own easily persuaded personal mythology promises that a mountain of delicious pies will be scooped from the flesh of this giant. It is heavy, and not as warty and irregularly formed as I was led to believe they are. I estimate that this one squash could make four small pies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems pointless to omit the Hubbard from my comparison of pie-squashes, so I will have to delay until I bake it into pies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

Leaning down to him, she points out Halloween decorations. "Look, a skeleton!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Aaaa!" he shrieks, utterly unfazed. He knows, however, that Halloween things such as skeletons are scary (his mother keeps telling him so), and that when something is scary, one screams. He runs around the room, yelling in excitement, hoping that his melodrama will carry off somehow and become real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Can I touch the spider?" he asks me. His mother tries to soften the blunt question by explaining to him "that man is trying to work." I let him touch the spider, as if I have any choice in the matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Is it real?" he asks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PtKHPAfCYB8/Tqes8vnVYBI/AAAAAAAADso/pYpdsrTItlY/s1600/IMG_0940.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PtKHPAfCYB8/Tqes8vnVYBI/AAAAAAAADso/pYpdsrTItlY/s200/IMG_0940.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Buttercup&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;As anyone who has bludgeoned oneself with epistemological questions in an academic setting would, I stammer. Then again my hemming and hawing is even more uncalled for than that because he seems not to be asking this question earnestly. Finally I say "no," laughing nervously. Having already said this, I tell myself that his mother seems dead-set on not just confirming but encouraging the childish delusions she presumes he has, and clearly this needs to be compensated for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because for some reason I always think that children are one step ahead of me, I'm overly pleased with myself for coming up with something vaguely clever to say, to smoke him out of his dishonest interest in the spider's authenticity: "Would you touch a spider that big if it were real?" I ask him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"No."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tkOd3oM0AKI/TqetAJmltEI/AAAAAAAADss/npWSgp0fU-E/s1600/IMG_0942.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tkOd3oM0AKI/TqetAJmltEI/AAAAAAAADss/npWSgp0fU-E/s200/IMG_0942.JPG" width="150" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;For the record, the spider above my head is pretty cool. It hangs from a wire spring that's attached to a fishing line running through a hook in the ceiling back to some device across the room that occasionally reels the line in and lets it back out, causing the spider to move up and down unexpectedly. They've really gone all-out filling this place with elaborate Halloween plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, yes, it's late October. Fall and Halloween decorations are everywhere about town, and winter squash litter supermarket storefronts in a simultaneously half-assed and exaggerated display of The Harvest. Triggered by a motion sensor, this coffee shop's bathroom advises me to "get out while you still can!" in a garbled voice emanating from a plastic skeleton with green LED eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gb0nC2CDAPQ/TqetIC5yj2I/AAAAAAAADs0/UYv5WF8La60/s1600/IMG_0944.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gb0nC2CDAPQ/TqetIC5yj2I/AAAAAAAADs0/UYv5WF8La60/s200/IMG_0944.JPG" width="150" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Delicata&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;It is also time to make pumpkin pie. Because that's what one does when the emaciated, struggling sun shines on yellow leaves. However, the large bins of winter squash in front of the Ashland Food Co-Op have run out of pie pumpkins. So I made squash pie. The trouble with winter squash is that, like apples, there are so many varieties and each one has vastly different properties. I can't keep track of them all. Every year I end up more or less blindly picking squash for pies and just to bake for eating with butter and brown sugar. I know that Acorn squash are good for the latter. Butternut squash (memorable for its beige color, it's pearish shape, and its enormity) I have a vague recollection of being horrible for pies, but used to good effect in ravioli and soup. I know have used Red Kuri and Green Kuri before, and that one of them has finely textured dry flesh and the other has more moist, slightly rougher texture, but I can't remember which is which. About the rest I know bugger all. So this time I decided to test two varieties I am unfamiliar with for their use in pie--Delicata and Buttercup (not to be confused with Butternut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lGOcd3lfJR8/TqetQ60bcQI/AAAAAAAADtA/-yI4GvpCgcU/s1600/IMG_0950.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lGOcd3lfJR8/TqetQ60bcQI/AAAAAAAADtA/-yI4GvpCgcU/s200/IMG_0950.JPG" width="150" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Buttercup&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;For the sake of science (err, if you can call it that) I tried to make the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; pie with the two different squashes, so that the difference would be in the texture and flavor of the squashes, not in the moisture content, spices, or sweetness. This wasn't that easy, as Buttercup is drier and less sweet than Delicata, which I tried to compensate for by adding more sugar and coconut milk. I used coconut milk because I wanted my brother and my girlfriend to be able to eat them, neither of whom can eat dairy. For the same reason I made the crust from rolled oats, butter, and brown sugar (because neither of them can eat wheat, either). However (and maybe I've said this before), let us not poo-poo oat-butter-brown-sugar crust. Having grown up with it (because of my mother and brother's shared allergies), I even like it better than pastry crust sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both squash I cut in half, scooped out the seeds and sticky bits, and baked open-face-down on a lightly oiled pan at 400 F. Delicata's flesh is yellow, Buttercup's orange.

Pour into a pie crust in a pie tin.

Put about 1 cup of the mixture into a pie tin and push it out into the sides of the tin to form a relatively cohesive wall around the circumference. Use as much as is necessary to cover up any gaps in the bottom of the tin.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9ulG-6jzoRM/TqetV-kQktI/AAAAAAAADtM/maxx6W4THtc/s1600/IMG_0955.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9ulG-6jzoRM/TqetV-kQktI/AAAAAAAADtM/maxx6W4THtc/s200/IMG_0955.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Left: Buttercup, Right: Delicata&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Conclusion? The Delicata pie was way better. It was smooth, and not mealy like the Buttercup pie. Apparently I didn't compensate enough for the Buttercup's dryness and blandness, because the Buttercup pie was still drier and less sweet than the Delicata pie. But even if I had, the texture and flavor just doesn't work as well. With slices of the two pies on a plate together, I found myself avoiding the Buttercup pie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, some other kind of milk might be better for a non-dairy pie. The coconut milk lent a strong coconut flavor when the pie was cold (when just out of the oven, my girlfriend and I couldn't taste coconut at all), which I'm not sure is desirable. But I guess the nice thing in theory about coconut milk is that it adds its richness to the pie, whereas, say, almond milk, would not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while Delicata wins, I now read &lt;a href="http://whatscookingamerica.net/squash.htm"&gt;on the Internet&lt;/a&gt; that Hubbard squash is "perfect for pies." So now I have to try it, obviously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4_OcQ-KQ_bE/TqetXdWZV1I/AAAAAAAADtQ/4-DvGfrxjms/s1600/IMG_0956.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="480" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4_OcQ-KQ_bE/TqetXdWZV1I/AAAAAAAADtQ/4-DvGfrxjms/s640/IMG_0956.JPG" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Left: Delicata, Right: Buttercup&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/ingredients-pantry/canned-pumpkin-what-is-it-really-made-of-069123"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; may induce eye-rolling, but did you know Libby's--that canned pumpkin brand that has set itself up as synonymous with pumpkin pie--is made from a variety of &lt;em&gt;Cucurbita moschata&lt;/em&gt; squash (the same species as Butternut), not &lt;em&gt;Cucurbita pepo&lt;/em&gt; (which includes pumpkins, zucchini, and Delicata squash)? My pies are not made from pumpkin or from Libby's, are set atop oats, and thinned with coconut milk. Are my pies real?

Toast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One cannot survive, it turns out, by sheer pluck. (Except in the filums.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;There. Sometimes I just have to get the declarative out of my system. These shiny sentences (okay, really not so shiny) just must be put down, however pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to say I find that as the weather gets colder I want to cook more. I find myself cooking new things, because, well, I am bored and stumble into things on the Internet. For instance, oladi. What are oladi? Russian kefir pancakes. Although some recipes I found called for sour cream or buttermilk. It's all roughly the same image--small pancakes made from fermented dairy products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gp7DmQz1aYs/Tp64Yw9ON0I/AAAAAAAADrc/GDzgpjDrZoA/s1600/IMG_0927.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gp7DmQz1aYs/Tp64Yw9ON0I/AAAAAAAADrc/GDzgpjDrZoA/s200/IMG_0927.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;batter&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Most every site skips the kefir part in their English translation of their name though, choosing simply "Russian pancakes." I will of course turn this molehill into a mountain of linguo-cultural powerplays. I know you count on me for this sort of thing. English has a word, "pancake," hence there is a category of things called pancakes, of which "Russian pancakes" are one. There are pancakes all over the world of various forms. "Pancake" offers us a way of seeing all these as variations on a theme. In France they do it that way, in Scotland that way, in Russia that way, and so on. Even &lt;em&gt;dosa&lt;/em&gt; are on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake"&gt;the Wikipedia page for pancake&lt;/a&gt;. It appears that all that is needed to be a pancake is to be cooked on a relatively flat surface heated from below and to be themselves relatively flat. It is a versatile word. Those Russian things can be called pancakes as well as those dry, horrible things one gets in IHOP. But one wouldn't call the Russian kind simply "pancakes"--this is a special pancake. Oh lord--what &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; I trying to get at with this tiresome rhetoric? That perhaps in some universe not permeated by English, oladi are their own thing, and not a subset of pancakes. But the cold war is over, and the "&lt;a href="http://tasterussian.com/"&gt;Traditional Russian Food&lt;/a&gt;" blog that is &lt;a href="http://tasterussian.com/russian-pancakes.html"&gt;the first Google hit for "oladi"&lt;/a&gt; declares "American recipes are my new passion!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m44dX7DiwMM/Tp64ay6AYpI/AAAAAAAADrg/TVHjx5dYNbM/s1600/IMG_0928.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m44dX7DiwMM/Tp64ay6AYpI/AAAAAAAADrg/TVHjx5dYNbM/s200/IMG_0928.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;take one&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Some of you are perhaps laughing and rolling your eyes that I'm seeking some "Traditional Russian Food" idyll of otherness, defending oladi as a Thing when I don't even know really what they are. Well, let's move on to exhibit two, the ingredient that defines oladi's difference and requires "Russian" to be tacked on to "pancake"--kefir. How do you say kefir? Being one of those annoying people who tries to pronounce foreign or even foreign-looking words correctly, I had always pronounced it "kehfeer". At some point I discovered that everyone else pronounces it "keefur". I won't bother defending my pathetic way of saying it, but I will say that "keefur" &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; like some kind of Americana--like one could, rather than getting a milkshake with your burger or hot dog, you could get kefir. It sounds, I don't know, hammy enough, drawly enough. Somehow it sounds not like a weird health food item at all, but something almost lude in its ordinariness, some kind of greasy staff of life. My point being that sounds matter. But sounds do not echo in a vacuum, either--in that sense "Russian pancakes" is true enough because all I hear in "oladi" is some kind of slavic-sounding word, and only that because I already read that they're Russian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bsTHxMekp1M/Tp64dWuSPpI/AAAAAAAADrk/jYOWfQEOPJE/s1600/IMG_0929.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bsTHxMekp1M/Tp64dWuSPpI/AAAAAAAADrk/jYOWfQEOPJE/s200/IMG_0929.JPG" width="150" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;take one&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Here is another way of looking at it: I made pancakes (for the fourteen millionth time), but this time I made them with &lt;em&gt;kefir&lt;/em&gt; (ooh la la), enabling me to have a five-hundred-word wank about "oladi" and English translations thereof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, anyway. Let me tell you: Do not attempt to follow the recipe in the first Google hit for oladi. Leave that to poor schmucks like myself. You, not being a schmuck, will probably recognize the problem with this recipe immediately from the ingredient list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 egg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 pt kefir = 0.5 liter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 tablespoons sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pinch of salt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;7-8 tablespoons flour&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon baking soda slaked in vinegar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uM9CE2jFC7o/Tp64eEJOvMI/AAAAAAAADro/3DRg3ghc46U/s1600/IMG_0931.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uM9CE2jFC7o/Tp64eEJOvMI/AAAAAAAADro/3DRg3ghc46U/s200/IMG_0931.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;take two&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Yes, that's 1 pint kefir (of course, you may wonder, as I did: U.S. or Imperial pint, neither of which, by the way, is actually half a liter), one egg, and 1/2 cup of flour. The batter is almost entirely kefir. That's like trying to pan-fry a yogurt parfait. (As a side note, yogurt might be another substitution for kefir, but for reasons I don't fathom, a wrong one. If I made pancakes from only yogurt, eggs, flour, and baking powder, they would come out horribly flat, dense, uncooked, and pudding-like on the inside. Pancakes made with kefir on the other hand can be made to be fluffy, I promise.) It sputtered like someone's effervescent sick in the pan--rather rude of it to do on the shiny cast-iron pan I cleaned for the occasion--and burned almost immediately. Despite being nearly ashen, the exterior was not crisp, and the interior was goo. For some reason, I ate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HKivNUdvdnY/Tp65qLfafhI/AAAAAAAADsA/tpPx7dc2vO8/s1600/oladi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HKivNUdvdnY/Tp65qLfafhI/AAAAAAAADsA/tpPx7dc2vO8/s320/oladi.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;the photo from Traditional Russian Food&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Also for some reason (well, actually, that's doubtful) it was only at this point it dawned on me that this recipe might be a bit dodgy. So I took immediate resuscitative action: I cracked another egg in there, and another half cup of flour. Still they hardly rose and their texture could hardly be called "cake". Another half cup of flour, and another teaspoon of lemon-juice-soaked baking soda. (I forgot to mention that this was the most unfamiliar part of this recipe: baking soda with vinegar poured over it. But I chose to use lemon juice, because I don't know--vinegar + pancake = ew?) Hallelujah, I had finally arrived at something resembling a pancake, and even resembling the pretty photos of golden discs that had drawn me to this recipe in the first place. It was too bad I didn't have any raspberries, rustic baskets, or unidentifiable green herbs. I would write down the recipe that actually worked, but I have unwittingly encrypted the proportions in the fact that I had already poured out some unknown portion of the batter before adding my extra ingredients. But basically it would be &lt;a href="http://www.enjoyyourcooking.com/main-dish-recipes/russian-kefir-pancakes-oladi.html"&gt;the second Google hit&lt;/a&gt;, which I turned to for guidance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a bit late to tell you anything about grilled zucchini, isn't it? Well, except that the deck where the grill stands is now too covered in leaves, dog shit, and bits of paper and plastic that the dogs have decided to chew for grilling to be an appealing proposition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left;

I will not tell you about cinnamon bread pudding with lemon-whiskey sauce. I will not tell you about mushroom sugo, which is what I had planned on making for this post. I don't remember how exactly I landed at &lt;a href="http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/mushroom_sugo/"&gt;the recipe page&lt;/a&gt;, but for some reason I had to make it. Maybe it was because it's the opposite of the simple &lt;a href="http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/09/potato-gnocchi-with-tomato-sauce-with.html"&gt;tomato-butter-onion&lt;/a&gt; equation. It has everything--mirepoix, wine, mushrooms, tomato sauce, beef broth. The expense of the ingredients I needed to buy to make it persuaded me to make something else. I have too much food at home, not too little, and the prospect of buying tons of ingredients to make something that only I was going to eat seemed a bit absurd. Of course, what I did make was as labor-intensive as the sugo was expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uqJk9yUZo4s/TpUdk-R7_PI/AAAAAAAADqg/265WDgmpr8s/s1600/IMG_0907.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uqJk9yUZo4s/TpUdk-R7_PI/AAAAAAAADqg/265WDgmpr8s/s200/IMG_0907.JPG" width="150" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;There is something a bit creepy about how I find myself approaching this blog: I feel that I have to make something new and exciting to post about. I would say this is just out of desperation for content, but no, usually I have plenty of other things I could write about, but instead I feel I have to put effort into something new to have permission to write these blog posts. As if somehow the effort put into making the thing is readable in what I write about the thing. God forbid I be lazy--it would show!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So instead I am lazy in other ways. The sweet potato gnocchi (because I had two sweet potatoes on the counter) &lt;a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Sweet-Potato-Gnocchi-with-Brown-Butter-and-Sage-233379"&gt;recipe I wanted to use&lt;/a&gt;, chosen because of its lack of egg or egg yolk, which I am told yields softer gnocchi, called for straining the fresh ricotta with a sieve and a piece of cheesecloth for two hours. Not having either of these things, nor wanting to take another two hours, I searched for a recipe without eggs that used unstrained ricotta. I found it, but the first recipe cut a corner that &lt;a href="http://agoodappetite.blogspot.com/2008/11/sweet-potato-gnocchi-with-garlic.html"&gt;this second one&lt;/a&gt; didn't: microwaving the sweet potatoes instead of baking them. Which took about twelve minutes. I have to say, making gnocchi went surprisingly quickly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lh4n5IDEMuY/TpUdlXsTTSI/AAAAAAAADqk/rfIKIY_Qy84/s1600/IMG_0908.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lh4n5IDEMuY/TpUdlXsTTSI/AAAAAAAADqk/rfIKIY_Qy84/s200/IMG_0908.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;To be honest I'm sick of brown-butter-sage-cream sauce, but for once it seemed like the best possible sauce for these gnocchi. Sage and sweet potato (or pumpkin) go very well together, and gnocchi are lovely drowned in dairy fat. Actually, now that I think about it maybe &lt;a href="http://www.restaurantdiningcritiques.com/america-restaurant-guide/new-sammys-cowboy-bistro-talent-oregon-u-s-a/"&gt;the high-priced, secretive bistro with their own garden down the road&lt;/a&gt; has the right idea with gnocchi: Serve them in a light, almost soupy sauce of herbs, butter, and sauteed vegetables. The problem with cream sauces is that they only amplify gnocchi's richness. Which would be wonderful if served with something else, (something stewed, perhaps, and not overly rich), but on its own its difficult to eat very much of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wadFvLTjS70/TpUdlv1JuJI/AAAAAAAADqo/-Rs4d7fUCmE/s1600/IMG_0909.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wadFvLTjS70/TpUdlv1JuJI/AAAAAAAADqo/-Rs4d7fUCmE/s200/IMG_0909.JPG" width="150" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The ricotta is supposed to give gnocchi a desirable texture (not gummy, but fluffy). That was what I was most excited about this recipe. I had always made potato gnocchi with potato, flour, and an egg. The egg is supposed to be the inferior but easier way to make gnocchi. I can’t remember why. Maybe the dough is more difficult to handle without the egg?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose I could do the whole “I will describe what I made in sensuous language” thing. They're orange pillows of delight--something like that. They were yummy, but I think maybe gnocchi should not be served alone. Or... Well, the most easily palatable way I've ever had them, actually, was with the tomato-butter-onion sauce. The gnocchi were not that great (dry packaged), but the sauce complimented them rather than doubled them. However, I'm not sure how well sweet potatoes would go with tomato sauce. Sweet with sweet? What would be the ideal sauce for sweet potato gnocchi?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They taste a bit like pumpkin pie (it must be the nutmeg), with sage. Maybe sage doesn't go with pumpkin and sweet potato after all. Who knows. What goes with anything else anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NIaKwhERDmU/TpUdmJ-Y6eI/AAAAAAAADqs/Ne6OKr3EIik/s1600/IMG_0912.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left;

Stale Bread (Bread Pudding with Caramel Sauce)</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DbCC8cjefyM/Tou74o-74eI/AAAAAAAADl8/UxIrCpH4BX8/s1600/IMG_0883.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DbCC8cjefyM/Tou74o-74eI/AAAAAAAADl8/UxIrCpH4BX8/s200/IMG_0883.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I know, if I was going to follow a Nigella Lawson recipe for bread pudding, I ought to have gone for her caramel croissant bread pudding, the one which shocks with fat like Paula Deen's Krispy Kreme bread pudding. I did not have croissants (actually the reason I wanted to make bread pudding was because I had stale bread) so I used her  "typical" &lt;a href="http://www.nigella.com/recipes/view/bread-pudding-5041"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt; for "thrifty pud."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't really follow it. I couldn't. In fact, I may as well have not bothered with the recipe, my fidelity to it was so loose. Trying to follow it as best I could, though, did provide me with a great deal of unnecessary work and frustration. What, really, does this blog survive on but those two?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--okT-Ak9-PI/Tou78Q0ptaI/AAAAAAAADmA/hYbdVwsnkro/s1600/IMG_0884.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--okT-Ak9-PI/Tou78Q0ptaI/AAAAAAAADmA/hYbdVwsnkro/s200/IMG_0884.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Where Nigella and I began miscommunicating was at the first ingredient: 8oz stale bread. I still don't know how to interpret this. I assumed that 8oz was half a pound, so I measured out half a pound of cut-up stale bread with a postage scale and a plate. The next step in the recipe said to "weigh out the rest of the ingredients," so maybe the previous ingredient was also to be weighed. Why, I wondered, were all the ingredients, even the spices, specified by weight? This was a ridiculous level of tedious precision for bread pudding. Oh well. I poured in the 1/2 pint of milk, which required a conversion because these are Imperial pints, each of which is roughly 1.2 US pints. As Wikipedia notes, yes, pints of beer in the UK are bigger. Still, half an Imperial pint is not much more than one cup. The recipe asked me to soak the pieces of bread in milk for half an hour. There wasn't much milk to soak in. It is difficult to describe the confusion that followed. Was this enough milk? Was Nigella suggesting these proportions intentionally, to create a crispy, dry bread pudding? Or did I not understand what 8oz meant? I'm pretty sure I don't, and that I still don't. It seemed clear to me, however, that the recipe was made for a smaller amount of bread. So 8oz wasn't much. But was this a volume measurement? Was 8oz roughly one cup? One cup of bread? In a seven-inch pan? That's a tiny bread pudding. I had already cut up all that bread, and begun soaking it, so I decided to adjust the recipe accordingly, with the assumption that 8oz was about a cup. (I got this from one of the many websites detailing the differences between British and American measurement systems that I looked at. Mostly, these websites told me things I didn't need to know, like how there were once many different gallons, one for each kind of good, and different quarts, pints, cups, ounces, etc, following from them. The American gallon, Wikipedia tells me, was once the British wine gallon.) I roughly measured the damp bread in my two-cup Pyrex measuring cup, and thought it was about four cups. Which meant that the whole recipe must be multiplied two and a half times. Why was that? Uh. Right, because I used the proportions of bread to milk from &lt;a href="http://www.momswhothink.com/easy-recipes/bread-pudding-recipe.html"&gt;a recipe in US measurements&lt;/a&gt;, and then based my multiplication on comparing the resulting amount of milk to the amount of milk in Nigella's recipe. The amount of liquid finally looked right--the bread was actually &lt;em&gt;soaking&lt;/em&gt; in the milk now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dRW0aIm6Gig/Tou79X6ketI/AAAAAAAADmE/QWQ4M9zY5H4/s1600/IMG_0890.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dRW0aIm6Gig/Tou79X6ketI/AAAAAAAADmE/QWQ4M9zY5H4/s200/IMG_0890.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;But my adjustments meant that I was supposed to use 2.5 cups of mixed dried fruit. That's a huge amount. Does Nigella prefer, or, indeed, do Britons in general prefer bread pudding that's more like panforte? This made me wonder if in fact my assumption about 8oz of bread being roughly a cup was wrong. (Please don't try doing the math now--you'll find it's incredibly wrong, I'm sure.) But no matter. I didn't have anything but raisins, and I didn't want to eat 2.5 cups of those, so I adjusted the amount to a little less than a cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HwqWAeaynEI/Tou7-u53qxI/AAAAAAAADmI/ovyGmlUma7I/s1600/IMG_0892.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HwqWAeaynEI/Tou7-u53qxI/AAAAAAAADmI/ovyGmlUma7I/s200/IMG_0892.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The recipe also called for two other things I didn't have: suet, and lemons. Again, I am not British, and therefore I do not have suet lying around my kitchen. As far as I knew up until trying this recipe, suet was a brick of fatty stuff that we feed to the birds outside. Apparently (again, Wikipedia is my source), it is a cut of raw animal fat, and is used in several traditional British dishes such as steak and kidney pudding. If my mind was not already spinning in a post-logical haze, here was the killing blow that released me from all reason: Nigella wanted me to use &lt;em&gt;low fat&lt;/em&gt; suet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut some butter into little ~1cm chunks and threw them on top of the mess right before I put it in the oven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ipsfGxXh-_A/Tou8AxYV2LI/AAAAAAAADmM/4fj3o3zP1WM/s1600/IMG_0893.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ipsfGxXh-_A/Tou8AxYV2LI/AAAAAAAADmM/4fj3o3zP1WM/s200/IMG_0893.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The lemons on the other hand sounded nice, but I just didn't really want to go to the store to get them. Lemon extract would've also done well here, but I didn't have that either. Rather than a lemon-spice bread pudding I would have a more mundane vanilla-cinnamon-nutmeg bread pudding. I didn't even have any booze. I thought of soaking the pudding in brandy, or rum, or of the Jack Daniels cream sauce from The Pioneer Woman Cooks! My bread pudding was going to be highly ignorable--more suited to breakfast than dessert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jvXx-HnVAOk/Tou8EHWAmGI/AAAAAAAADmY/SWDV5WVhRxo/s1600/IMG_0900.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jvXx-HnVAOk/Tou8EHWAmGI/AAAAAAAADmY/SWDV5WVhRxo/s200/IMG_0900.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Except that in preparation for making bread pudding, I had bought a pint (a little American pint) of heavy cream. I also had a large bag of white sugar in the cupboard, and plenty of butter. I would make caramel sauce! Having made tarte tatin a bazillion times, I figured I could wing it. Apparently I derive pleasure from winging it. The idea is: &lt;em&gt;I'm hot shit--I know how to make caramel sauce without anyone having to tell me&lt;/em&gt;. Put some butter and sugar in a hot pan until it begins to caramelize (not long! I didn't have those insulating apples!), and then pour in the cream to stop the burning. Yeah, okay, I screwed it up the first time, making a sauce that was so heavily burnt that I ended up pouring it down the sink. The second batch, while still very dark, was palatable. I might even say it was good. I say as I scoop with my finger cold dollops of it from a bowl in the fridge into my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say recently has definitely been the kind of weather one imagines for bread pudding: grey, cold, and damp. While what I made bears almost no resemblance to Nigella's recipe, I'm sure she would approve of lazing around inside eating spoonfuls of hot, buttery pudding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ExGqEMduDsw/Tou8Fbv-G0I/AAAAAAAADmc/GkAQnVc9OzI/s1600/IMG_0901.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ExGqEMduDsw/Tou8Fbv-G0I/AAAAAAAADmc/GkAQnVc9OzI/s200/IMG_0901.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rI7Y5G_4KNs/Tou8BzcX4AI/AAAAAAAADmQ/30EntEh96c8/s1600/IMG_0897.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; display: inline !important; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rI7Y5G_4KNs/Tou8BzcX4AI/AAAAAAAADmQ/30EntEh96c8/s200/IMG_0897.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HmWtkIjwJcw/Tou8DJg39II/AAAAAAAADmU/Fu-i89Wwfh4/s1600/IMG_0898.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; display: inline !important; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HmWtkIjwJcw/Tou8DJg39II/AAAAAAAADmU/Fu-i89Wwfh4/s200/IMG_0898.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vzCsNQjPPl0/Tou8GiMtJoI/AAAAAAAADmg/XAfMRkuovi4/s1600/IMG_0903.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vzCsNQjPPl0/Tou8GiMtJoI/AAAAAAAADmg/XAfMRkuovi4/s1600/IMG_0903.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bread Pudding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 cups cut-up stale bread (squished down a bit)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 2/3 cups whole milk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 eggs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2/3 cup brown sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3/4 cup raisins&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 tablespoons butter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons cinnamon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon nutmeg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 teaspoons vanilla&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a mixing bowl, pour milk over stale bread and let soak for half an hour. Preheat oven to 350 F. Add eggs, brown sugar, raisins, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla. Mix gently with a spoon. Pour mixture into a well-greased 9x9 baking dish. Chop butter into ~1cm cubes and sprinkle over the top of the mixture. Bake for an an hour and fifteen minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caramel Sauce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons butter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2/3 cup sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;~3/4 cup heavy cream&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a large saucepan with a heavy bottom on high heat, melt butter. Add sugar. Stir vigorously with a spatula (the kind that won't melt). Scrape the sides often. As soon as all the sugar becomes liquid (most of it will have caramelized) add 1/2 cup of the heavy cream, remove from heat, and stir. If sauce is too thick, add more cream.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/10/8-oz-stale-bread-bread-pudding-with.html' title='8 oz.

I didn't make gnocchi. I bought dry, packaged gnocchi from the store and boiled them. Marcella Hazan's recipe calls for either fresh tomatoes or whole canned tomatoes, cut up, in their juice. I apparently bought the wrong kind of canned tomatoes, because they didn't have juice. They had tomato puree. I do not understand why this is a product. I did not chop up the tomatoes very small (although Hazan does not specify how small they should be chopped), and I only remembered to chop them at all halfway through simmering. I sliced them with a chef knife while they were in the saucepan, holding them in place with a large fork. In any case, you can decide if that matters. It was still tomatoes simmered with butter and an onion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WTopviiKS9M/ToFXLIBT8CI/AAAAAAAADlY/q1HvKNVE1YE/s1600/IMG_0838.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WTopviiKS9M/ToFXLIBT8CI/AAAAAAAADlY/q1HvKNVE1YE/s200/IMG_0838.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It was good. Sniffing the air, my brother asked what was in it. Butter. Lots of it. Actually less than was called for: The recipe called for two cups of tomatoes, and five tablespoons of butter. I used the whole can of tomatoes, which was about three cups. I didn't have enough butter to account for this change. I only had six tablespoons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ATJFlstwFOk/ToFXLr_xzSI/AAAAAAAADlc/IAkRzQvb9Wk/s1600/IMG_0840.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ATJFlstwFOk/ToFXLr_xzSI/AAAAAAAADlc/IAkRzQvb9Wk/s200/IMG_0840.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Hazan says it's "an unsurpassed sauce for Potato Gnocchi." I was excited about this. I definitely wanted to make gnocchi with this sauce. Making gnocchi from scratch is a pain. Preserved, store-bought gnocchi has a strange after-taste. I forgot to get gnocchi or ingredients to make gnocchi when I was in the store buying ingredients for the sauce. I made the sauce anyway, planning to get gnocchi from the store later. I did, but only after I ate the sauce with Costco tri-color bow-tie pasta because I was hungry and because I did not have a car with which to go to the store to buy gnocchi. The sauce, covered in parmesan, was good. It was quite salty. Hazan suggests salting sauces beyond what tastes right on their own, because the sauce has to cover not very salty pasta (or gnocchi). This seems like good advice. What I am not convinced of is that this sauce is unsurpassed for gnocchi. Butter on gnocchi is good, and this has lots of butter. The sauce on its own is good. Was it perfect for the gnocchi? I don't know. I am used to just butter and parmesan, or just butter, or butter and cream. In fact eating these reminds me that when I was much younger my mother used to buy packaged gnocchi (the kind one refridgerates), and I loved to eat them with (salted) butter. Nothing but butter, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4-SNx2WDyPE/ToFXMf4YzCI/AAAAAAAADlg/AFTgIPk5riA/s1600/IMG_0841.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4-SNx2WDyPE/ToFXMf4YzCI/AAAAAAAADlg/AFTgIPk5riA/s200/IMG_0841.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Some other bloggers have raved about this sauce. One called it a revelation. It is good. It is elegant. It is edifying: One does not need tons of herbs, or any at all, to make good tomato sauce. One of my friends goes so far as to say herbs &lt;em&gt;mess up&lt;/em&gt; tomato sauce, which I am hesitant to agree with. Herbs have their place. But perhaps, like Hazan says of garlic, they should be used with intention in particular circumstances, not by default.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe next will be bolognese. I tried making pseudo-bolognese the other week. I used a great deal of red wine, which curdled the cream. At least I think it did. It was difficult to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--C39JkFo-P0/ToFXNiV3TjI/AAAAAAAADlk/rIsOw0nbkjU/s1600/IMG_0842.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--C39JkFo-P0/ToFXNiV3TjI/AAAAAAAADlk/rIsOw0nbkjU/s200/IMG_0842.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: none; color: black;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NykYWXjmCmc/ToFXPMUiXTI/AAAAAAAADlo/faZQq3mnpBw/s1600/IMG_0843.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; display: inline !important; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NykYWXjmCmc/ToFXPMUiXTI/AAAAAAAADlo/faZQq3mnpBw/s200/IMG_0843.JPG" width="150" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: none; color: black;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-r11WJu3DWsA/ToFXQPvHx5I/AAAAAAAADls/drRKRKWNcZQ/s1600/IMG_0845.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; display: inline !important; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-r11WJu3DWsA/ToFXQPvHx5I/AAAAAAAADls/drRKRKWNcZQ/s200/IMG_0845.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YNar9P51NSU/ToFXQ2NHtAI/AAAAAAAADlw/IXMlyq4gK54/s1600/IMG_0846.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YNar9P51NSU/ToFXQ2NHtAI/AAAAAAAADlw/IXMlyq4gK54/s320/IMG_0846.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/09/potato-gnocchi-with-tomato-sauce-with.html' title='Potato Gnocchi with Tomato Sauce with Onion and Butter'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/8719258452815721640/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/09/potato-gnocchi-with-tomato-sauce-with.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8719258452815721640'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8719258452815721640'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/09/potato-gnocchi-with-tomato-sauce-with.html' title='Potato Gnocchi with Tomato Sauce with Onion and Butter'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1mgo4ytPHao/ToFXKvUAO0I/AAAAAAAADlU/fnwwMDAD4OI/s72-c/IMG_0833.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-1934197477738201525</id><published>2011-09-19T21:30:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.362-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Pasta</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MsFSbkNtGZg/TngTGJHHqqI/AAAAAAAADjo/pMPfl9xoW1o/s1600/IMG_0800.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MsFSbkNtGZg/TngTGJHHqqI/AAAAAAAADjo/pMPfl9xoW1o/s200/IMG_0800.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Back in the day, we used to make fresh pasta. Making foods whose production was showy was a thing we did. Before I became a part of that adolescent social economy, they made crepes. Not only was making crepes a show, but it could be made into group activity. One might make the batter, another pour it, and the last, the one who got all the glory, babied and flipped them. This particular person liked to burn himself by using his fingers to flip the crepes. He (of course it would be he) was known back in those days as The Devil. God bless him. (No, really. His cooking sensibilities have definitely become a part of mine, and his enthusiasm and adventurousness were indispensable in such endeavors.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-A6IQSVf3PR0/TngTGbXAkeI/AAAAAAAADjs/dN6SrnensjM/s1600/IMG_0801.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-A6IQSVf3PR0/TngTGbXAkeI/AAAAAAAADjs/dN6SrnensjM/s200/IMG_0801.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The Devil and I made pasta a lot. We made it at both of our houses. We made it at gatherings. We even made pasta in Germany, where we convinced ourselves it was Spaetzel. We made it always in the same way (except in Germany, where we could not find semolina flour). I have no idea where we came upon this way of making it, and I don't remember ever reading a recipe. The Devil suggested it authoritatively, and off we went. At no point was there any textual reference, but now I will have to make one. This is what we did:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-J-ls5HdOoI4/TngTGsVOuUI/AAAAAAAADjw/SHV9IawRJeQ/s1600/IMG_0802.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-J-ls5HdOoI4/TngTGsVOuUI/AAAAAAAADjw/SHV9IawRJeQ/s200/IMG_0802.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In a mixing bowl we put some semolina flour. We made a little crater in the flour into which we cracked as many eggs as were necessary to make the dough just cohere, a little olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt. We mixed this together, eventually using our hands to form the dough into a ball and knead it. We kneaded it quite a lot. It was as if we were making a material for construction rather than pasta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We divided this into fist-sized (my fists, or smaller) balls, and we rolled (sometimes with a rolling pin, often, because we thought it was cool, with a wine bottle) each ball into a thin, skin-like strip. We would either run these through the pasta maker (a birthday gift, I think) or cut it into triangular shapes with a chef knife. We would always make fettuccine with the former, and the latter we liked to call Spaetzel. The fettuccine we would lay across a chair to dry. Apparently, the pasta is supposed to dry before you plop it into boiling water. I don't think we ever bothered to dry the Spaetzel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3GETvJPO1Ac/TngTHOL3H_I/AAAAAAAADj0/JZY028KH8Tg/s1600/IMG_0803.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3GETvJPO1Ac/TngTHOL3H_I/AAAAAAAADj0/JZY028KH8Tg/s200/IMG_0803.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This of course wouldn't take long to cook. It just needed to be boiled briefly, perhaps a minute or two. It was always delicious, but a bit stiff. I always wondered about that, sometimes chocking it up to that simply being the way that fresh pasta tastes. I may have made passive-aggressive comments to The Devil to the effect that perhaps we shouldn't have been making the dough so stiff. We continued making it in the same way, and on my own I too would make it in this way. There was something aesthetic about the process and the ingredients. It was a very yellow pasta. Every ingredient was in some way yellow: semolina, eggs, olive oil. We felt (or at least I felt) that there was a wholesome purity in this combination. This was substantial, dense stuff. Who needed anything but this pasta? I wanted to invest all my gustatory faith in the one, which invariably was something involving flour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_B0cBkfITtg/TngTHTdXVKI/AAAAAAAADj4/rBGXRi-gVgc/s1600/IMG_0804.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_B0cBkfITtg/TngTHTdXVKI/AAAAAAAADj4/rBGXRi-gVgc/s200/IMG_0804.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;However, because technically I am no longer eighteen and because I feel obligated to have actually cooked something for this post (why I bother, I don't know) I have decided to try something new: I used a recipe, and I did not use semolina. Semolina, Marcella Hazan complains, "is often grainy, even when it is sold as pasta flour, and grainy &lt;em&gt;semolina&lt;/em&gt; is frustrating to work with." She is my guide today, a wonderfully clear guide, and so I made fresh pasta with unbleached all-purpose flour, because the "talcum-soft white flour," &lt;em&gt;doppio zero&lt;/em&gt;, is not readily available to me (although really, this is Ashland, surely either Market of Choice or the Ashland Food Co-op has this imported flour), and because this is what she uses "when outside of Italy."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wrCRioK2pwI/TngTH3lPQ5I/AAAAAAAADj8/VzZFUtzAjC8/s1600/IMG_0807.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wrCRioK2pwI/TngTH3lPQ5I/AAAAAAAADj8/VzZFUtzAjC8/s200/IMG_0807.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The trouble is that while I am not eighteen, I am still just as lazy and prone to cut corners. So I did not follow Hazan's homemade pasta routine to the letter. For one thing, I did not knead the dough for eight minutes. Kneading for three minutes was an exercise in confusion: I kept accidentally sliding the cutting board I was kneading on forward in sudden violence, knocking over various glass-bottles over with the force. Happily, they all had lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oey6pq-r3Tk/TngTIVDPhLI/AAAAAAAADkA/QABbkKpxi1w/s1600/IMG_0808.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oey6pq-r3Tk/TngTIVDPhLI/AAAAAAAADkA/QABbkKpxi1w/s200/IMG_0808.JPG" width="150" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;For another thing, I didn't lay the strips of pasta dough on towels or cloths as she suggested, but instead on the vinyl tablecloth, which they stuck to. This is a bad idea. Don't do it. Lastly, I did not dry the strips sufficiently, nor did I lay out the finished pasta in such a way that it would not stick to itself. This meant that my pasta was a knotty, sticky mess before I put it all in the pot to boil, and afterward merely a knotty mess. Obviously you shouldn't do that either. Or do. The subtleties of good cooking are lost on most (certainly not Anthony Bourdain, who is reportedly angered by most food), including, for the most part, myself. Most will be startled enough by the taste of fresh, homemade pasta that the stiffness of pasta stuck together will not faze them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the whole process has emphasized to me is that making pasta properly is a pain in the ass. Maybe if I were a more patient person, I would take pleasure in the labor. Leave it to a professional. Unless you are in the mood to be happily distracted by the rigors of precise pastamaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rH71DgcZX6w/TngTI-1fMxI/AAAAAAAADkE/ON9V12V3cJw/s1600/IMG_0809.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rH71DgcZX6w/TngTI-1fMxI/AAAAAAAADkE/ON9V12V3cJw/s200/IMG_0809.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I am a hobby practitioner of cooking, not a specialist or a professional, and one whose techniques ossify. Of course, a technique &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; ossified. But a good one has been molded by a million mistakes until it becomes something crystalline, unassailable as a means to achieve the desired results. If you want to change a good technique, you want to achieve something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't bring this up without reason (although I do; this is just a justification). Pasta has come out of an elaborate hierarchy of specialization. (Yes, there is a definite sloppiness in my use of "hierarchy" here.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First there is the growing of wheat. Not that I've done a whit of research into the topic, but I'm guessing you can't really have your own personal wheat field out back and sustain yourself (or your small family) from it. To get the amount of wheat needed to be useful, it must be grown in very large fields, tended by those who do very little but grow wheat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4B7LTj8lKNk/TngTJUsuOsI/AAAAAAAADkI/kniRA7y7dI4/s1600/IMG_0810.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4B7LTj8lKNk/TngTJUsuOsI/AAAAAAAADkI/kniRA7y7dI4/s200/IMG_0810.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Then there is the milling of wheat into flour, then shaping the dough into the often intricate shapes of pasta. You get the point, however vague it is. Specialization, agriculture, industry, bla bla bla. Moving on. Hazan insists, like Julia Child does with every complex technique, that with a pasta maker and a bit of practice at getting the consistency of the dough right, it is "extraordinarily simple" to "produce fine, fresh pasta inexpensively, at home." Yeah, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PClF9DM7abo/TngTKA_h_yI/AAAAAAAADkM/UUQKHLc84GY/s1600/IMG_0811.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PClF9DM7abo/TngTKA_h_yI/AAAAAAAADkM/UUQKHLc84GY/s200/IMG_0811.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Although I no longer want one calorically dense food to sustain me entirely (nor do I think that one will), I am still almost as much of a megalomaniac non-specialist as I was then. I want to be able to do many things well, and I want to do so with very little effort. I think this is called "arrogance." But then, cookbooks and guides are for the most part for hobbyists, not professionals. Cooking does not need to be locked up in guilds of professionals, but can be done surprisingly well by bored people with a distaste for cheap, packaged food. You too can make delicious homemade pasta. The problem is there isn't enough time in the world. It's better, really, to look at my photos and drool. Actually don't. Look at someone else's--they're bound to activate your salivary glands far more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YWXa7YhEGD0/TngTKh-kFII/AAAAAAAADkQ/IiarXsl4Nm4/s1600/IMG_0812.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

Well, no, I had two of the worst; it's difficult to say who was worse. But she owned the first place I had ever rented. Every year for Thanksgiving (or was it Christmas?) she cooked the food of a different nation. She complained to me that she had run out of cuisines, and might have to start repeating. I am fairly certain that this list did not include Portuguese cooking. Just like the 1972 edition of &lt;em&gt;The Joy of Cooking&lt;/em&gt; doesn't have Eggplant Parmesan, the most recent edition probably doesn't have Portuguese sweet rice. Not that I'm pretending to purvey "authentic" food from the far corners of the Earth. I only mean that so far as I know there is not a Portuguese dish that has become hip and iconic in the U.S., simultaneously symbolizing the nation and being its own thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One does not combine milk with lemon, or anything else acidic, unless one is making buttermilk. This doesn't mean lemony creamy things are completely out--there is hollandaise (which uses lemon more for its chemical properties than its flavor) that combines lemon with butter and egg yolks. Egg yolks don't mind. There is lemon-cream sauce, although I have not tried it (I assume that since it takes tomatoes without curdling it can handle lemon, but maybe not). There is lemon curd, of course, which has nothing to do with dairy, and the filling for lemon bars, which is basically lemon curd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But apparently it's possible to get the scent and flavor of lemon without the acidity. (What do lemons taste like without citric acid? Damned good, but I don't know.) It's called lemon extract, and I had no idea it existed until my girlfriend informed me that it lent the thick, creamy confection I was eating its lemony flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You use both the juice and the zest, or just juice?'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She gave me a bewildered, somewhat offended look. "Lemon juice? No no, we use lemon extract."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not convinced. Surely lemon extract could not duplicate the bright, fresh flavor of lemon zest and juice? I guess. But it would curdle the milk. And it might actually be better than fresh lemons. I do love extracts. More accurately, I love the smell of extracts. Lemon extract, almond extract, rose water.  Almond extract makes a pie of grapes taste like cherries, makes sugar cookies amazing, and completes frangipane. Rose water gives lemonade a lovely fragrance and a needed bitterness. Lemon extract makes sweet rice something other than yet another rice pudding. Although the egg yolks already make it thicker (more or less solid) and more yellow than most. The color creates an interesting illusion of lemon. At least, when I tried it I assumed the color was from the lemon I tasted, not egg yolks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't remember the recipe we used from a cookbook.

I know, you're thinking what is she feeding her poor family? Has she gone vegetarian and taken them down with her? Dear Husband is as suspicious as you are, and even more suspicious of my excuse of forgetting to buy meat today, but the caprese won him over. (Secretly, though, I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been leaning in the meatless direction. It's so healthy, and good for your heart, and I get tired of meat every day. I don't need to worry about what the DH thinks, he never reads my blog, thank God.) It's a hit all around, so colorful and so Italian! Little freddie hates tomatoes, but after I forced him to eat one bite of caprese--a slice of tomato, a slice of mozzarella, and a basil leaf or two--he couldn't stop eating it. I had to slice up some more tomatoes and pick more basil from our little garden to make us more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tl7CgILnsyo/TmZV7_NrkSI/AAAAAAAADgw/6eJn0Rz8okk/s1600/IMG_0751.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tl7CgILnsyo/TmZV7_NrkSI/AAAAAAAADgw/6eJn0Rz8okk/s200/IMG_0751.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;look at that delectable little tidbit,&lt;br /&gt;like a tiny Italian flag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The tomatoes I planted back in early July have finally been putting on fruit and ripening beautifully. Nobody believed me that they'd grow because I'm a black thumb, but I like to think it's getting a bit grey, maybe. Here they are, deep red, sweet, and with that wonderful tomato smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DH calls the potatoes I make "terrorist fries." That's not an insult. He loves them, but from day one has called them that. To be honest I've forgotten why. Oh yes, the first time I made them it was during the Bush years, and there was all this anti-French sentiment floating around, which he had to mock by calling them Terrorist instead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Lej1FRgtJoo/TmZV7JTHmyI/AAAAAAAADgs/9gSLB0OMI6E/s1600/IMG_0750.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Lej1FRgtJoo/TmZV7JTHmyI/AAAAAAAADgs/9gSLB0OMI6E/s320/IMG_0750.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;~&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, as fun as that was, I can't really see the point in making fun of Mormon mothers who blog about cooking for their families. Really it would be much more fun to &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/life/feature/2011/01/15/feminist_obsessed_with_mormon_blogs"&gt;read them yourself&lt;/a&gt;. I cannot possibly match &lt;a href="http://aspicyperspective.com/2010/09/roller-derby-pies.html"&gt;the genius&lt;/a&gt; of: "My hubby and I have a new house rule for guarding our waistlines. If you MUST have it, you must MAKE it from scratch!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the end, about my imaginary husband's political commentary (actually my brother's), just sounds like me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a problem with fall: that it is fall. I don't really need to spell it out for you, but I will. Summer is ending. The light is lower. It's getting colder. The porch is already getting covered in dead leaves. I've apparently given up trying to write semicoherent posts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gdcUQ_dvL1U/TmZV4gfGefI/AAAAAAAADgk/kUaqt6wty3g/s1600/IMG_0748.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gdcUQ_dvL1U/TmZV4gfGefI/AAAAAAAADgk/kUaqt6wty3g/s200/IMG_0748.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Anyway, I'm surprised that I haven't posted something about "terrorist fries" here before. Maybe it was because I didn't want to share the silly name. Really I'm not sure what else to call them. Chips? What does one call thick-sliced potatoes roasted with lots of olive oil. They taste more or less like french fries, but round, and with a somewhat different texture (in part because the potatoes are never Russet, the variety used for french fries). Like french fries or chips they're good with barbecue sauce, or salt and malt vinegar, or this time I used balsamic because I didn't have any malt vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-F6qbMTLAN8Y/TmZV5T79d4I/AAAAAAAADgo/E5pE1NdIypc/s1600/IMG_0749.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-F6qbMTLAN8Y/TmZV5T79d4I/AAAAAAAADgo/E5pE1NdIypc/s200/IMG_0749.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;There are a limited number of foods I make when I don't really know what to make, and these are one of them. When I need something starchy to go along with odds and ends from the fridge, I often make these. Somehow, throwing them in the oven set to 450 F seems easier than, say, putting on a pot of rice. Their delicacy lies in how thickly they are sliced (about 1cm), which somehow seems less daunting than the subtleties of timing and proportions of water to rice. Sure, I could overbake the potatoes, too, but as long as I check them every couple of minutes, they're very easy to visually assess. When they are browned to your liking, they are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KRtkwWIQIVE/TmZV8qGkcZI/AAAAAAAADg4/FhkFRgakWs8/s1600/IMG_0754.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KRtkwWIQIVE/TmZV8qGkcZI/AAAAAAAADg4/FhkFRgakWs8/s320/IMG_0754.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;They are my brother's creation, although I suppose I increased the oven temperature, at first more out of haste than to create the desired consistency. I don't remember exactly how they came about, but I believe it was when we were having a LAN party. If you know what that is, then I need not say any more, and if you don't, you need not know any more. We were making baked beans and tangelo meringue pie, and, well, maybe we wanted something to go with the baked beans. Maybe we had no potato chips, and one of us suggested (it seems like this would be me) that we &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; potato chips. I think that was it. I remember us saying to each other that they weren't quite potato chips (they weren't crispy all the way through), they were still really good. Good enough to have stuck, apparently.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/09/terrorist-fries-and-caprese.html' title='Terrorist Fries and Caprese'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/8675740739689537790/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/09/terrorist-fries-and-caprese.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8675740739689537790'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8675740739689537790'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/09/terrorist-fries-and-caprese.html' title='Terrorist Fries and Caprese'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OOqBWLf8xyk/TmZV8RZjsoI/AAAAAAAADg0/pKcxf11iqYg/s72-c/IMG_0753.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4056367513414762324</id><published>2011-08-28T19:18:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:57:24.370-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Blackberries</title><content type='html'>Wouldn't it be cool if Himalayan blackberries really came from those mountains? Not really, but my brother and I have constructed a whole mythology around it. It's strung together with a kind of botanical personification: The Himalayan blackberry is so incredibly and invasively successful here because its native home is far harsher. Adapted to cold, cold winters and very little water, here it thrives. Like the Himalayas are a bramble boot-camp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qCTEUAcWuZc/Tlrz-5U8E4I/AAAAAAAADfM/wLhBofTWlns/s1600/IMG_0730.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qCTEUAcWuZc/Tlrz-5U8E4I/AAAAAAAADfM/wLhBofTWlns/s320/IMG_0730.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There is a certain logic to this. They are so at home here and so impossibly hardy that they must come from some otherworldly place, and the Himalayas are that to us, rising to elevations we have never visited and on the other side of the earth. There is something alien in the brambles' utter familiarity with the landscape. Nothing native could grow so well--nativity, after all, must be nurtured. These cannot be destroyed. They will come back year after year from dry slashed up root matter forgotten in the ground. Up my street there is a family who for three years chopped them down, pulled them up, burned them, and sprayed them. They still persisted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Rqbq4uCpc2c/Tlrz_sJNLOI/AAAAAAAADfU/FYVfqYikbdM/s1600/IMG_0734.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Rqbq4uCpc2c/Tlrz_sJNLOI/AAAAAAAADfU/FYVfqYikbdM/s320/IMG_0734.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;This year's new canes where they were "removed" last year.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;My brother and I always laugh when a restoration project we're working on as &lt;a href="http://nwbiolog.com/"&gt;employees of my father&lt;/a&gt; involves pulling up blackberries and planting native plants in their place. We know it won't really work. It's amazing, really, the destruction that these plants excite in people like us. The same people who are melancholy about Arizona's immigration legislation happily engage in what amounts to a campaign of firebombing on an immigrant who was brought here more than 100 years ago. Last year there was a volunteer effort to remove what looks like a multiple acre swath of nothing but blackberries along Ashland Creek. It's doomed, of course, unless the same thing is done every year. This year the new canes have grown quite tall. If anything is clear to me, it's that Himalayan blackberries are here to stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they are non-native and invasive, and thus the perfect scapegoat. We need them to be our punching bag. Without the millions of brown, slain blackberry canes, the native plants planted there would not be so proudly native. The category of native has been eked out through an extensive labor of killing Himalayan blackberries. And other species, sure, but mostly them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is all hocus-pocus. To most of us, blackberries are blackberries. We do not know them as native and non, Pacific and Himalayan. They are simply that ubiquitous bramble that in the late summer bears purple berries. They are the landscape that they "invade."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Didw2zBCvl8/Tlrz_Cet48I/AAAAAAAADfQ/H4TiekleeRQ/s1600/IMG_0732.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Didw2zBCvl8/Tlrz_Cet48I/AAAAAAAADfQ/H4TiekleeRQ/s320/IMG_0732.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Though I always wondered if perhaps they came from the lower, greener slopes of the Himalayas, I admit that I didn't know until just now that in fact, if we care to deal in fact, they have nothing to do with the Himalayas. Apparently, Luther Burbank, an American horticulturalist, visited India and there found some blackberry seeds in a market. He grew them, liked them, and decided to call them "Himalayan Giant." Wikipedia and others have pinned down the species' origin to Armenia, &lt;a href="http://www.scn.org/cedar_butte/cb-himal.html"&gt;someone&lt;/a&gt; going so far as to say that the only correct scientific name of the plant is Rubus &lt;em&gt;armeniacus&lt;/em&gt; Focke (much taxological confusion surrounds it, called by &lt;a href="http://www.ars-grin.gov/ars/PacWest/Corvallis/ncgr/cool/rub.aliens"&gt;several names&lt;/a&gt;: "R. &lt;em&gt;procerus&lt;/em&gt; Muller, R. &lt;em&gt;praecox&lt;/em&gt; Bertol., R. &lt;em&gt;grabowskii&lt;/em&gt; Weihe ex Gunther et al., or R. &lt;em&gt;discolor&lt;/em&gt; Weihe &amp;amp; Nees") &lt;a href="http://thegardenpalette.wordpress.com/2009/08/19/the-%E2%80%98-black-sheep%E2%80%99-of-the-berry-family/"&gt;A gardening blogger&lt;/a&gt; went even further, stubbornly (like a teacher's pet) referring to them as "Armenian blackberries." It is undoubtedly true they are of the region of Armenia, but what of destiny? Who is to say that this plant wasn't meant for world domination any more than it was meant for Armenia? To go even further, and &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; "naturalize" these things, who's to say it wasn't meant to be massacred?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It bleeds so deliciously. Well, alright, it really doesn't need to be injured or killed to yield its sweetness. Actually, more likely if you pick the berries &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; will get pricked. Picking blackberries marks you; your hands become stained violet, berry juice sometimes mixed with a little blood. You come back scratched up but happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VZocXPcJ9jE/Tlrz-h2jq0I/AAAAAAAADfI/zbisyXA2280/s1600/IMG_0728.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VZocXPcJ9jE/Tlrz-h2jq0I/AAAAAAAADfI/zbisyXA2280/s320/IMG_0728.JPG" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;There are quite a few considerations involved in picking blackberries. The first is water: those bushes that grow near water or are irrigated (like near a grassy field) have fatter fruit. Personally, I prefer the places that provide shade, as picking in the late August weather is liable to kill you. My brother is a proponent of two things for serious picking: the two-by-six and the plastic gallon milk jug. The two-by-six (preferably salvaged from lumber scrap) is dropped on top of a productive but mostly inaccessible patch, and used as a platform from which to reach the berries nobody else could. The milk jug, the top 1/8 or so cut off with a knife, is the preferred berry-collecting device: it has a convenient handle, a large opening, and holds quite a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although my brother is now wary of the herbicides, diesel fuel, and god knows what else contaminating the soil near the railroad tracks, the tracks near the middle school used to be one of our favorite places to pick. I remember one day in late August when we drove there in his cream-colored Mercedes diesel (to run biodiesel, of course) as enormous slate walls of cloud grew above us. It was late in the day, and the light slanted yellow from a slit of unclouded horizon. The excessive details added up then to more than they do now: The four of us picked for an hour, until we were pelted with hail. It hurt, and we ran into the car with our various buckets (gallon milk jugs with the tops cut off, yogurt containers, paper bags, who knows what else) full of berries. Like a scene in an excessively nostalgic film, the fun bulged out a little nastily. The hail increased as we drove to the store, making more and more worrisome sounds on the steel roof. One of us (not me) used a newspaper to shelter himself on his way into the store to get oats, butter, and ice cream. Like all memories, it was mostly made up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dOVd2RMy3jk/Tlrz_6T0wMI/AAAAAAAADfY/FWPgzQRqdFI/s1600/IMG_0735.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dOVd2RMy3jk/Tlrz_6T0wMI/AAAAAAAADfY/FWPgzQRqdFI/s320/IMG_0735.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The object of all this youthful running about in a stormy idyll was blackberry crisp a la mode, of course, though we always called it cobbler. In fact "crisp" sounds wrong to me--it couldn't possibly refer to a baked dish of berries topped with (and sometimes lined with) a mixture of oats, butter, and brown sugar. We always made it that way because both my brother and my mother were allergic to wheat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baking a crisp was my goal when I picked today, but there weren't enough berries, and the hours of wandering around in the heat looking for enough berries exhausted me. So I will have fresh blackberries with various dairy products: ice cream, yogurt, (lightly) whipped cream. How terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NbLDF9VcBz4/Tlrz5RE4jQI/AAAAAAAADfE/3P41uvLagF4/s1600/IMG_0739.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NbLDF9VcBz4/Tlrz5RE4jQI/AAAAAAAADfE/3P41uvLagF4/s320/IMG_0739.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Fresh blackberries are yummy, but baking them in a crisp softens their flavor for good reason: The blackberry is a queer tasting fruit. It's not even clear it is one fruit. The same bush yields various tastes: bitter, sweet, gasoline-like, bland and mealy, moldy, almost always a little sour, and sometimes very sour. Sometimes you accidentally eat an ant, which has its own acrid, strangely complimentary taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much in my life has revolved around blackberries. The first outing an ex (and now friend) and I had together was, I think, picking blackberries. One of my best childhood friends, who is no longer alive, used to eat red, unripe berries from the wall of brambles at the edge of the middle school. He had something to prove, I guess. One summer not too long ago (which probably means something like five years ago) my oldest friend and I made blackberry milkshakes. (Inevitably one of you is now laughing at your own joke: my milkshakes bring all the boys to the yard.) None of these memories are endemic to blackberries, because blackberries do not need endemicity. They pop up all over the place, given just enough water.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/08/blackberries.html' title='Blackberries'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/4056367513414762324/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/08/blackberries.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4056367513414762324'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4056367513414762324'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/08/blackberries.html' title='Blackberries'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qCTEUAcWuZc/Tlrz-5U8E4I/AAAAAAAADfM/wLhBofTWlns/s72-c/IMG_0730.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8759867281488824020</id><published>2011-08-22T15:26:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:59:16.011-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Gluten-Free Baking Part II: Bob's Red Mill Shortbread Cookies and Chocolate Chip Cookies</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ygJDeKu2faE/Tk8P3J3FA1I/AAAAAAAADaw/vUL_qJJ2EH8/s1600/IMG_0726.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ygJDeKu2faE/Tk8P3J3FA1I/AAAAAAAADaw/vUL_qJJ2EH8/s320/IMG_0726.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I suppose I should have photographed the whole process, showing you everything, plenty for your tactile imagination to chew on. But this isn't &lt;a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/"&gt;The Pioneer Woman Cooks!&lt;/a&gt; or some other shiny cooking blog. All I have are photos of the baked cookies themselves, which don't much illustrate the difficulty of making them. You can see the paraplegic cat, and a few other limbs broken off. This could've happened at one of a few points: transferring the cut dough shapes from the counter to the baking sheet, transferring the baked cookies off of the baking sheet, and simply handling the cookies to eat them. The package told us, like the chocolate chip cookie mix of the same brand, that the dough would seem dry, and that we needed to squish it together with our hands, and to roll it out between parchment paper and plastic wrap to 1/4 inch. How exactly did we do this without the dough crumbling to pieces? With difficulty. The package suggests using a cookie cutter. It does not suggest the acrobatics involved in getting the cut dough to the baking sheet. We carefully removed the layer around the shapes, trying not to break the shapes themselves, and used a spatula--quickly, quickly--to lift them in one piece (or, if the maneuver isn't executed perfectly, several). Irregular shapes with lots of limbs sticking off didn't fare well. The pumpkins were okay, being essentially a circle with a tiny bit sticking off (the stem).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--BySmkvRJjk/TlLWNvhTawI/AAAAAAAADcI/jXJqsTy98U8/s1600/IMG_0710.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--BySmkvRJjk/TlLWNvhTawI/AAAAAAAADcI/jXJqsTy98U8/s200/IMG_0710.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I've never made shortbread cookies, regular or no, but what was the structural integrity these cookies were lacking? Gluten. I imagine regular (dare I call them that?) shortbread dough would stay together easily enough that it could handled with less care than nitroglycerin, and that the baked cookies would not be so delicate that they faint when they see a mouse. (Of course, &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2011/04/purple-pork-and-night-butter.html"&gt;when I saw a mouse in my kitchen at night&lt;/a&gt; I might've hit my head I jumped so violently.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hh7OJG-uIDI/TlLWOEQXd6I/AAAAAAAADcM/tmMpAfushYE/s1600/IMG_0723.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hh7OJG-uIDI/TlLWOEQXd6I/AAAAAAAADcM/tmMpAfushYE/s200/IMG_0723.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I complain, but the shortbread cookies were good, if messy, to eat. How can you go wrong with something that's mostly butter? The texture was a little grainy, becoming not quite the fine paste in the mouth that I'm used to from regular shortbread, but rich and a little sweet, as they should be. A nice tea biscuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, all legumes taste similar. Bob's Red Mill is partial to garbanzo bean flour in gluten-free baking mixes. Their chocolate chip cookie mix is mostly comprised of it, at which our noses twitched in mild disgust. Garbanzo beans and chocolate chips? Ew. Why not, say, oats? (The funny thing about &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2011/08/gluten-free-baking-part-i-simulation.html"&gt;gluten-free baking&lt;/a&gt; mixes is that each has a completely different approach to achieving the texture and flavor desired. Some are mostly rice, some oat, some garbanzo, some teff. Usually the actual ingredients are downplayed; the end result is everything. Which is odd these days, when every "organic" or "natural" product is busy bandying its ("simple," "pure") ingredients.) We didn't trust it, but we did already open the package, so what the hell. The cookies turned out beautifully, melting into the pan in folds of buttery chewiness (sorry, no photos). The flavor was unexpected, but not at all unpleasant. I devoured five in one sitting.

The over-there in question was Japan, because the owner of the recently opened Ichigo Cake, who is one of those male Niponophiles who is married to a Japanese woman, mentioned a type of rice-based chiffon cake made in Japan. There is a kind of hysterical traditionalism that the idea of gluten-free baking excdites in me at times. It's not just traditionalism, but a metaphysics of substance: &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;, I think, &lt;em&gt;how is it bread if it isn't made from wheat?!&lt;/em&gt; The whole idea of gluten-free baking is heretical and challenging to this mindset. One tries to make something without the ingredients that have traditionally defined it. There is also the kind of gluten-free baking that adapts to the different qualities of other grain flours, making something entirely new and owning rather than trying to hide its uniqueness. But most gluten-free baking reaches toward realness: seeming indistinguishable from the gluten-based baked-good that it simulates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is because of how it resembles transexual politics that my knee-jerk reaction of "it's not real" seems so backwards. But there is of course a more visceral reason to defend gluten-free baking: for some, gluten really is poison. For my brother it's an allergen, something which makes him mucousy and plugged-up like he has a cold; it causes my girlfriend's immune system to go haywire, damaging her digestive system in its violent wake. (This is my dramatised picture of Celiac.) There are also, I hear, those who vow to go off wheat or gluten for health reasons, even though they have felt no ill effects. I find these people hard to disginguish from those who quaff wheat grass at juice bars. Children have the best neologisms: healthoholics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I said "experiment," i was thinking of a gluten-free bakery that's starting uncertainly in Phoenix (about five miles away), &lt;a href="http://www.giasglutenfree.com/menu.html"&gt;Gia's&lt;/a&gt;. The small, slapped-together storefront feels harried as you walk in. There isn't an employee at the counter, but a man with a walkie-talkie who I have a feeling is either related to or married to the baker. He communicates with the bakery itself across the parking lot, radioing that we're out of this or that, are you making more? This leads me to think that they have so little startup capital that they must reduce their risk by making tiny, on-demand batches and/or they just don't have the oven space to make enough at once to meet demand. Just opened a month ago, they're stilll figuring out how much of what customers will buy, and moreover are still probably gaining customers as the word of their existence spreads around those that want gluten-free. For the time being they'll just use what they've got. The cash register is a laptop hooked up to a receipt printer. The occasional cashier will come away from the bakery into the shop only when customers are afoot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as well as a business experiment, it's an experiment in baking. They're perfecting their recipes, looking for the right combination of flours and for the kinds of pastries people like. I am told the lemon bars are a hit. Personally I fell for the succulant carrot cake, which I didn't even realize was gluten-free until I felt the texture of rice flour in my second bite. My father had brought some home from the Talent Art Show (this is not some horrible exercise in naming--Talent is a town a few miles north of Ashland) where they were selling cupcakes as teasers for their bakery that was yet to open. There was chocolate and carrot cake. At least one of you is laughing at me, but I'm telling you, the carrot cake was far more tempting. At the time I didn't know its lusciousness (alas, there are only so many adjectives one can use to describe cake) was gluten-free; it was just some delicious cupcake from wherever. This, I suppose, is the simulationist gluten-free baker's dream. Gia's is exactly that. A recent &lt;a href="http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20110803%2FLIFE%2F108030301"&gt;Mail Tribune article&lt;/a&gt; says that "Jan Thorsell wants fellow sufferers of celiac disease to feel 'normal' when they walk into her new bakery." The normal customers also get to feel normal cake on their tongues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, in &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2011/08/gluten-free-baking-part-ii-bobs-red.html"&gt;Part II&lt;/a&gt;: a recent joint foray into gluten-free baking: chocolate-chip cookies and shortbread cookies.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/08/gluten-free-baking-part-i-simulation.html' title='Gluten-Free Baking Part I: Simulation'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/8423954834679389273/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/08/gluten-free-baking-part-i-simulation.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8423954834679389273'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8423954834679389273'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/08/gluten-free-baking-part-i-simulation.html' title='Gluten-Free Baking Part I: Simulation'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-9204773661048133317</id><published>2011-08-12T20:37:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:59:16.016-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Pizza</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EooElbXF_RU/TkWBI2FO-NI/AAAAAAAADYo/I9oFsjcWtfk/s1600/0812111227.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EooElbXF_RU/TkWBI2FO-NI/AAAAAAAADYo/I9oFsjcWtfk/s320/0812111227.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;My father has decided that "they" call me "Mira 'Pizza' Skibinski." Not without reason. I've made pizza three times in the past week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the summer I always seem to be drawn to making pizza, despite the fact that turning on the oven when it's ninety degrees outside seems absurd (or, alright, just environmentally insensitive). When it's not delivered to your door as the quintessential late-night food, baked (or rather fried) in "deep dish" swimming with grease, two-inches thick and covered in various kinds of meat, I think of pizza as a summer food. In part this is because I grow basil in the summer (for some reason I've never been one of those enterprising people who grows it in a little windowsill pot when it's too cold for it to survive outside). What is pizza without fresh basil? (Yes, I know, I'm stuck on this.) It's also simply because my image of pizza is a summery image: thin, brightly colored, light(ish), bathed in sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8O2HdBQITjk/TkWBJ4Q7_eI/AAAAAAAADY0/NW-sGr-PEVw/s1600/0812111208a.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8O2HdBQITjk/TkWBJ4Q7_eI/AAAAAAAADY0/NW-sGr-PEVw/s320/0812111208a.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In other words, my love of fresh pizza is slightly sneaky nostalgia for Italy. Even though what I make bears little resemblance to the thin snack I devoured there, it is that which I long for by making these things, I admit. I know it's not cool any more to think of Europe as the gastronomical promised land (unless you're Elizabeth Gilbert), as it was in the 30s and 40s when M.F.K. Fisher was visiting and dreaming of France. Nor is it 1961. Nor am I Julia Child. But let's be honest: I have silly idyllic daydreams of European food. There is nourishment and there is nourishment. I create this delusion that I'm creating Europeanness for myself more via the combining of Mediterranean ingredients than any meticulous attention to technique or finished product. As long as it has the right stuff--tomato sauce, mozzarella, fresh basil, maybe olives--and sort of looks like I imagine it should, I am content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XVwUdjigj5E/TkWBJfB9OeI/AAAAAAAADYs/RZslxIV3lwQ/s1600/0812111211a.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XVwUdjigj5E/TkWBJfB9OeI/AAAAAAAADYs/RZslxIV3lwQ/s320/0812111211a.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Generally I put these ingredients atop thin slices of good bread (in Ashland that's hearty, sour New Sammy's Cowboy Bread or La Baguette's French Sourdough, which is so fluffy that it becomes rock-hard stale in two days), and throw it in a hot oven for fifteen or twenty minutes. Recently I've discovered that the Ashland Food Co-op makes pizza dough and sells it in plastic bags. I've been looking for exactly that ever since I left Bar Harbor, where the local bakery sold bags of the stuff as well as the supermarket, but only recently did I actually find it here (because god forbid I, you know, &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt;). If I were one of the bazillion mothers who blog about what they feed their families, I would say that I have found a relatively quick and easy way to make pizza "from scratch," and wink as if I'm passing on some scandalous corner-cutting secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could say that their fresh dough is immeasurably better than bread. While the flat bread that comes out of the oven is fresh, its texture is tame and crispy like a cracker, where the bread slices are chewy and crunchy. This could be because I haven't kneaded the dough; it hasn't been stretched into the pizzeria crust I'm wishing for. But it's hard enough squishing the dough into the right shape without kneading it at all. Should I be kneading it and tossing it? Is that the only way to get it to not bounce eagerly back into itself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5gLOJrd8M10/TkWBKBTSyUI/AAAAAAAADY4/6bLb5TxwqQw/s1600/0812111208.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5gLOJrd8M10/TkWBKBTSyUI/AAAAAAAADY4/6bLb5TxwqQw/s320/0812111208.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I think, however, there is a certain romance in my lazy pizza-crust-making process. I plop the blob of dough into the glass roasting pan (we lack a cookie sheet or anything else more appropriate at home), which has a little olive oil on it. I dust the top with some white flour to keep it from sticking to my hands, and mash it down with fingers and fists. Once it's relatively flat, I begin stretching instead of squishing, until it roughly fills the whole pan. When the oven reaches 475 degrees, I lather and arrange all the ingredients on top of the dough, and bake it.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/08/pizza.html' title='Pizza'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/9204773661048133317/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/08/pizza.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/9204773661048133317'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/9204773661048133317'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/08/pizza.html' title='Pizza'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EooElbXF_RU/TkWBI2FO-NI/AAAAAAAADYo/I9oFsjcWtfk/s72-c/0812111227.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-1713196479407316612</id><published>2011-08-05T17:45:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:59:15.959-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Sage &amp; Browned Butter</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-219KbgeYpKk/TjyNa5GRZgI/AAAAAAAADXQ/7p0gHIR0Jfs/s1600/IMG_0692.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-219KbgeYpKk/TjyNa5GRZgI/AAAAAAAADXQ/7p0gHIR0Jfs/s320/IMG_0692.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It never quite stays the same, but the same basic two ingredients do: butter and sage. The butter must be browned and the sage, fresh. Most of the time over these is poured cream, which bubbles into a sauce. But this last, it could be said, just dilutes the flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was taken from two friends' repertoires, both of whom exalted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one loved gnocchi more than the sauce she bathed them in, but aren't gnocchi a vehicle for sauce? She made gnocchi to bring decadence to our poorly deprived college lives of hippie lentil soup and mac n' cheese. The time-consuming and detailed labor of gnocchi were supposed to bring us out of the fraught, gaudy world of a small New England liberal arts school to somewhere more expansive. Like, say, Italy, after which she pined by kneading dough and smooshing it delicately with a fork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the sauce. Her method was to pour some cream into a saucepan with lots of fried sage leaves, simmer it down until it thickened into a sauce, and salt it to taste. This made a sumptuous covering for the pillowy lumps. As such rich sauces are bound to, it drew us all salivating in only to leave us for dead at the table, feeling sick and wanting to collapse into our half-finished plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other was following a recipe for pumpkin ravioli with brown butter and sage, and was enamored, in her self-consciously understated way. She dropped sage leaves into melted butter and burned the butter just so. This is the base, and sometimes the whole, of every permutation of my sauce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a kind of paranoid respect for the flavor of sage and browned butter. I don't think it should be messed with. Olive oil is, I feel, an evil addition to it. Other herbs, even black pepper, should be shunned from sage. Garlic is too much competition, and its cloying, under-your-fingernails savoryness clashes with sage's sharp scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The furthest I have strayed from the holy diad has been to incorporate bacon and finely chopped onions. This may have been too far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xSfTEdy7TzI/TjyNbTQXCiI/AAAAAAAADXU/ASsC6SeasMc/s1600/IMG_0694.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xSfTEdy7TzI/TjyNbTQXCiI/AAAAAAAADXU/ASsC6SeasMc/s320/IMG_0694.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I do think that the recipe for pumpkin ravioli had it right: the flavor of sage and browned butter should be paired with something a little sweet. But I rarely do this. I have become more attached to the sauce than its place in a dish. I pour it over any old pasta. Once I even put it &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2010/08/saucy-leftovers-roasted-chicken-and.html"&gt;on chicken and mashed potatoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the sage leaves have become brownish and brittle in butter, I often remove them before the cream makes them soggy. These crispy, butter-soaked leaves are hard not to devour on the spot, but I like to sprinkle them as a flavorful garnish.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/08/sage-browned-butter.html' title='Sage &amp;amp; Browned Butter'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/1713196479407316612/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/08/sage-browned-butter.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1713196479407316612'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1713196479407316612'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/08/sage-browned-butter.html' title='Sage &amp;amp; Browned Butter'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-219KbgeYpKk/TjyNa5GRZgI/AAAAAAAADXQ/7p0gHIR0Jfs/s72-c/IMG_0692.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-6200643569460556896</id><published>2011-06-12T18:49:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:59:15.995-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Roasted Bell Pepper Obsession</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--VIh8BuLcM8/TfVXq7CxXkI/AAAAAAAADOs/9F9YxPZNTrg/s1600/IMG_0664.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--VIh8BuLcM8/TfVXq7CxXkI/AAAAAAAADOs/9F9YxPZNTrg/s320/IMG_0664.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Sometimes I cook a dish not to feed or for a subtle balance of flavors, but out of single-minded, monistic, shameless, worshipful obsession. It works like this: I didn’t need four adjectives to describe this kind of obsession, especially not both of the first two. But to have &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; of one thing, I need a &lt;i&gt;variety&lt;/i&gt; of sameness. How do I create more roasted bell pepper? By adding other things, flavors spinning around a center always just to the side of roasted bell pepper. The center is almost the sauce, everything bound together in cream. The other things are just drawn out aspects of the original: bacon smokey like them, smoked paprika essentially the same as them, but dried and powdered. Then there are those forgotten things: onions and garlic sauteed in olive oil. What metaphor to turn to (the search for which is itself a good metaphor for what it is to organize a dish around a single ingredient)? Melody, harmony, and rhythm?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-M9tQ9xXPAqQ/TfVXqnPeLzI/AAAAAAAADOo/LvHpREbcZeQ/s1600/IMG_0660.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-M9tQ9xXPAqQ/TfVXqnPeLzI/AAAAAAAADOo/LvHpREbcZeQ/s320/IMG_0660.JPG" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;1 pound tiny yellow, orange, and red bell peppers&lt;br /&gt;1/4 pound bacon ends&lt;br /&gt;1 smallish onion&lt;br /&gt;4 cloves garlic&lt;br /&gt;2 tablespoons olive oil&lt;br /&gt;1 cup heavy cream&lt;br /&gt;2 teaspoons smoked paprika&lt;br /&gt;a pinch of black pepper&lt;br /&gt;salt to taste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chop onion and garlic finely. In a large saucepan on medium-low sautee onion and garlic in olive oil. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Stir every few minutes. Heat a large cast-iron skillet to medium heat. Cut tops off of bell peppers, slice in half, and de-seed. Drop bacon ends into skillet, then bell pepper halves. Stir bell peppers when bottom sides blacken a bit. When bacon ends are a little charred, and majority of bell peppers are somewhere blackened, transfer into large saucepan with onion and garlic. Mix together and add smoked paprika and black pepper. Add heavy cream. Stir every few minutes while the sauce thickens. It should take maybe fifteen minutes to thicken. When it’s the right consistency to stick to pasta, add salt to taste.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/06/roasted-bell-pepper-obsession.html' title='Roasted Bell Pepper Obsession'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6200643569460556896/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/06/roasted-bell-pepper-obsession.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6200643569460556896'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6200643569460556896'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/06/roasted-bell-pepper-obsession.html' title='Roasted Bell Pepper Obsession'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--VIh8BuLcM8/TfVXq7CxXkI/AAAAAAAADOs/9F9YxPZNTrg/s72-c/IMG_0664.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-9138418482763547279</id><published>2011-06-04T02:18:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:59:16.013-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Why I Make Pancakes</title><content type='html'>While I am not yet eating eggs with a comb out of a shoe, there is dog shit on the porch, mouse shit on the counter, a pile of week-old dishes soaking in putrid water in the sink behind which festers a crust of black mold, and grain moths hatching from and having their way with god knows what forgotten stash of dry goods. There’s no use denying it, I live in a house full of slobby men, and I am one of them. I flee from the mess I can’t stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sight of the disgusting, somewhat toxic kitchen adds an unhealthy layer to my morning grumbling: I am loathe to cook anything, and for the first hour manage only to put the tea kettle on. On rare exuberant mornings I might wash some of the dishes while the water comes to a boil. Most of the time, though, I just pace around bemoaning the unendurable injustice of having to prepare and eat breakfast. This morning I stooped to a new low by making quesadillas for breakfast. They tasted largely of rubber and heartburn, but there wasn’t anything else around I could imagine being able to stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After sitting in denial of my bodily needs in front of the computer with a cup of tea, reading new emails or perusing Google Reader for new amusements, most mornings I end up making pancakes. It is difficult to explain why I do this. I, and perhaps you, wouldn’t think that mixing together pancake batter from scratch is the solution for someone who wants non-nasty breakfast with minimal effort. Why not, say, cereal? It is the result of a collection of interconnected, deeply entrenched kitchen habits. I never think to buy cereal. I often buy yogurt, thinking that I’ll eat that in the morning, and I do, but it’s never enough to just eat yogurt. What else do we keep in the kitchen that’s palatable for breakfast? Well, there are eggs. Sometimes, there is bread, and when there is I make eggs on toast. But somehow, even though it is basically the same ingredients, fried eggs and buttered toast are more nauseating than pancakes. Also there is oatmeal, in my mind the least vomitable substance despite looking a bit like vomit, but I made the mistake of buying steel-cut oats. They are delicious, but take about half an hour to cook properly. I don’t get the normal, rolled variety because why buy those when I have the kind I will never use? Basically, I cook pancakes to not think about what to make for breakfast. They are the status quo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when the kitchen is disgusting, it is still somehow possible to scrape off whatever grime is on the cast iron pan and while it heats get out the pyrex measuring cup, crack an egg in, add milk, oil, flour, baking powder, and salt, mix it with a fork, and wait until the pan is hot. It’s a ritual that can happen amid squalor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is a very starchy, tiring food. Eat a couple of pancakes and you may just want to go back to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having written this, maybe I should invest in some muesli.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/06/why-i-make-pancakes.html' title='Why I Make Pancakes'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/9138418482763547279/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/06/why-i-make-pancakes.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/9138418482763547279'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/9138418482763547279'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/06/why-i-make-pancakes.html' title='Why I Make Pancakes'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-7281799973325543709</id><published>2011-05-19T10:53:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:59:16.004-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Banana Bread: A Recipe in Photos</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

And even then I was not so much attempting to perfect a single recipe as I was exploring variations thereof. I am habitually scattered. After Tarte Tatin it seems that where cooking is concerned I want to try many things, and not try, try again the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence while I have been cooking the same core ingredient (chicken drumsticks--they’re cheap) over and over recently, there has been very little &lt;i&gt;work&lt;/i&gt; involved. I just try something different every time. What I try is largely dictated by what is around: lemons one day, cherry tomatoes another, and today, dates. The beauty of these things is transient. It lies in the coalescing of an improvisation into something that tastes good, miraculously. Subtlety and discernment are out of the picture. Those finer qualities only take form and may be tasted through repetition. But these dishes, unless they are a disaster, are the best thing at the moment they’re served. Very rarely do they happen again. Yet I write recipes for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9WshrrwQ2aA/TaXNoIkIbCI/AAAAAAAADJk/me1jheqvQeg/s1600/IMG_0600.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9WshrrwQ2aA/TaXNoIkIbCI/AAAAAAAADJk/me1jheqvQeg/s200/IMG_0600.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;5 chicken drumsticks&lt;br /&gt;1/2 onion&lt;br /&gt;1 small carrot&lt;br /&gt;~15 pitted dates&lt;br /&gt;juice of 1/2 lemon&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup water&lt;br /&gt;2 tablespoons cooking oil&lt;br /&gt;1/2 teaspoon cloves&lt;br /&gt;2 teaspoons cinnamon&lt;br /&gt;1/2 teaspoon black pepper&lt;br /&gt;~1 teaspoon salt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZSD9yQydcyU/TaXNoYNUyyI/AAAAAAAADJo/EGivNbMb5eo/s1600/IMG_0601.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZSD9yQydcyU/TaXNoYNUyyI/AAAAAAAADJo/EGivNbMb5eo/s200/IMG_0601.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Two hours ahead of time salt both sides of chicken drumsticks--a generous pinch for each side of each drumstick--and let sit on a plate to warm to room temperature. In a small bowl pour lemon juice over pitted dates, add cloves, cinnamon, and black pepper, and mix together with a spoon. Slice onion half in half against the grain, and then chop into small pieces with the grain. Slice carrot in half lengthwise and then chop both halves into small pieces. Set oven to 450 F. Oil a small square baking pan, place onions and carrots in the pan, and put it in the oven. In a large saucepan on medium-high heat with a bit of cooking oil, quickly brown both sides of drumsticks (this should only take a couple minutes per side). Move drumsticks and date-lemon-spice mixture to baking pan, mix everything together in pan, and let it continue to bake at 450 F. After twenty minutes, flip over drumsticks, stir vegetables, add 1/2 cup water, and continue baking. When drumsticks are done and the bottom of the pan has turned to a thick sauce, it is done.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/04/drumsticks-with-dates.html' title='Drumsticks with Dates'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/3018426119411606654/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/04/drumsticks-with-dates.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3018426119411606654'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3018426119411606654'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/04/drumsticks-with-dates.html' title='Drumsticks with Dates'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y9rnKX92b1Y/TaXNpDIEwUI/AAAAAAAADJw/rZq4wbmN7PE/s72-c/IMG_0605.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-5383453864627063723</id><published>2011-04-08T15:32:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:59:15.990-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Sour, Spicy, Smokey Drumsticks</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pBFe0O44-3Y/TZ-K7mw3IgI/AAAAAAAADJM/WAioxPYhHoI/s1600/IMG_0590.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pBFe0O44-3Y/TZ-K7mw3IgI/AAAAAAAADJM/WAioxPYhHoI/s320/IMG_0590.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In moments of unfounded, starry-eyed optimism, I think of myself as one who can and will eat whatever. I think &lt;i&gt;I’ll eat the dregs of the pantry, making strange yet nourishing dishes!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What such notions actually lead me to is standing lightheaded in front of the fridge, wanting something even mildly appealing to appear, and making myself sick with toast and butter. It is a terrible thing because not only is everything worse without food in the belly and sugar in the blood, but also in such a state it is impossible to think creatively about what to eat. &lt;i&gt;Just give me something.&lt;/i&gt; Having fallen off the boat so to speak, I have been awash in endless Costco food items, which I choke down (whoops, there goes the ocean metaphor) in insufficient and nauseating quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realized that cooking for myself in a deliberate way is not an indulgence, it is a way to get myself to want and not just to need to eat. It keeps me in a stream of gustatory desire, so that I do not wither away in disgust. There is undoubtedly some psychological peculiarity belied by my need to control and be actively involved in the process of making food. But the point is, cooking is important, damn it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so we arrive at the last thing I cooked. It is in some way inspired by Adobo, which is not something I have ever made, and have only tasted once. Having been mostly distrustful of sourness in savory cooking, it is now a novelty that I want to explore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qmaSPxarGp0/TZ-K7OZ-qgI/AAAAAAAADJI/1pmDcfa8n2w/s1600/IMG_0589.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qmaSPxarGp0/TZ-K7OZ-qgI/AAAAAAAADJI/1pmDcfa8n2w/s320/IMG_0589.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;2 tablespoons cooking oil&lt;br /&gt;4 chicken drumsticks&lt;br /&gt;1/2 a medium cabbage&lt;br /&gt;1 large onion&lt;br /&gt;3 cloves garlic&lt;br /&gt;3 small dried jalapenos&lt;br /&gt;juice of 2 lemons&lt;br /&gt;juice of 1 large orange&lt;br /&gt;2 teaspoons smoked paprika&lt;br /&gt;salt (1/2 teaspoon?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sprinkle salt on both sides of drumsticks. Cut cabbage half and onion into thin radial slices. Smash garlic cloves and chop into largish pieces. Chop dried japapenos into largish pieces. Juice lemons and orange and reserve juice. On high heat, heat oiled saucepan until oil begins to smoke. Being careful not to burn yourself, lay drumsticks in pan and cover with lid or towl to keep oil from splattering everywhere. Brown both sides (a few minutes on each side) of drumsticks and remove to a plate. Reduce heat to medium-low. Fry garlic and dried jalapenos for about ten seconds before adding cabbage and onion slices and stirring to coat everything in oil. Increase heat to medium and fry vegetables for five minutes, stirring every minute or two. Add chicken drumsticks, blanketing them under the vegetables. Add citrus juice and smoked paprika. Reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Cook for roughly half an hour, or until chicken is cooked all the way through.

There was very little that went the way I intended baking this lemon cake. Wanting to make the two-layer yellow cake from &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2011/03/rooibos.html"&gt;the Tick Tock box&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://kittyinthekitchen.blogspot.com/2011/03/lemon-pound-cake-with-lemon-glaze.html"&gt;MinCat’s recipe for lemon cake with lemon glaze&lt;/a&gt; looked delicious and like it could become what I wanted. Rather than using a bunt pan, I would divide the batter into two circular cake pans and use the glaze both over the top and between the two layers. It would look like the tiny picture. I do not have even have one circular cake pan. But no matter. Excited about my plan, I bought four lemons. They sat on the counter for almost a week, and my brother informed me that one of them was molding. The mold transformed the urgency of making cake from always present every morning but always put off, to &lt;i&gt;this must happen today&lt;/i&gt;. It was only at this point that I actually read the recipe, and discovered that it called for yogurt, which I did not have. I didn’t care, I just wanted to make cake, to use the damned lemons, and to get material for this post. The layering would still happen somehow. I would bake a 9x13 cake, cut it in half, layer the halves on top of each other. I just had to make the batter. Recently I have noticed that I am almost incapable of actually reading a recipe. This time my skimming reduced making the cake batter to: sift the dry ingredients, mix together the wet ingredients (including sugar), and then mix the dry with the wet. I missed the fact that the lemon juice was not one of the wet ingredients, but a part of a syrup that is poured over the cake when it’s just out of the oven, and the rest goes into the glaze. While it was baking I toyed with making the syrup anyway for an ultra-lemony cake. I still had two more lemons, only one of which I needed for the glaze. But the syrup and and the glaze both got tossed out as ideas after I forgot about the cake and left it in the oven for at least twenty more minutes than I meant to. The edges came out a bit burnt. I rationalized that I didn’t want to waste glazes and syrups on such a bungled cake, but I think I was just already so half-assed about making this cake that this one thing gone slightly wrong gave me an excuse to give up on the endeavor entirely. But the thing is, this slightly over-baked lemon cake is good. Unadorned, unpretentious, and refreshingly but not overpoweringly lemony, it goes very well with tea. I’ll try the layer cake when I have the proper pans and all the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;1 1/2 cups flour&lt;br /&gt;2 teaspoons baking powder&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup water&lt;br /&gt;1 cup sugar&lt;br /&gt;3 eggs&lt;br /&gt;zest and juice from 2 lemons&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup vegetable oil&lt;br /&gt;1/2 teaspoon vanilla&lt;br /&gt;1/2 teaspoon salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preheat oven to 350 F. Sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Whisk the water, sugar, eggs, zest, juice, vanilla, and oil until well combined. Whisk dry into wet mixture. When combined, bake for roughly 50 minutes, or until fork comes out clean from the center.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/04/over-baked-lemon-cake.html' title='Over-baked Lemon Cake'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/3723921143951755889/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/04/over-baked-lemon-cake.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3723921143951755889'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3723921143951755889'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/04/over-baked-lemon-cake.html' title='Over-baked Lemon Cake'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Hem6kwpVhj8/TZlBIn4E7cI/AAAAAAAADIo/qi6ZYO8w5Xc/s72-c/IMG_0587.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4574213965749391156</id><published>2011-03-30T19:59:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:59:15.985-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Lemon-Tomato Pork &amp; Asparagus Stir-Fry</title><content type='html'>I get stuck on cooking techniques, throwing different ingredients into the same rubric. Lately it is some lower-heat variation on stir-frying. I fry things on medium-high heat until they are browned, and then add a sauce, usually containing something sweet, which cooks a bit and possibly caramelizes while it coats the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3MRUiq66Gp0/TZPtY8DBVLI/AAAAAAAADHY/8il2Qvzvkpo/s1600/IMG_0584.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3MRUiq66Gp0/TZPtY8DBVLI/AAAAAAAADHY/8il2Qvzvkpo/s320/IMG_0584.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Maybe I liked this because I ate it like finger food with bread and a pool of salted olive oil, or because it was something fresh, not the same crap I find myself eating day after day. If I see another egg, another slice of buttered toast, another pancake, another bowl of yogurt with jam, another grilled cheese sandwich, or another salad of Costco greens, I might vomit. Or despair. Or more likely, something far less dire. That is the problem: alas, one cannot not eat for days and then have an occasional exciting gustatory experience. Life is so hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strangely, I am not describing this as something disgusting. I’m not even describing it. I’m just saying that I liked it.

When I was on a collage meal plan, there were an assortment of tea bags, one of which was Tick Tock. Drawn by the bold white lettering on red, the fact that it said "rooibos" and "caffeine free" at the bottom completely passed by my attention. In other words, I mistook it for a brand of black tea, possibly akin to English breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Not that I actually remember, but mistaking it for proper tea makes a better story than, say, drinking it because I wanted to avoid caffeine and had heard about rooibos. Because the point I'm trying to make is the allure of the packaging, not the benefits of decaffeinated beverages or the goodness of rooibos. But at some point, whether before or after I discovered Tick Tock I’m not sure, I was avoiding caffeine, having decided that coffee did terrible things to me. But even on that point I don’t know: was I reacting against coffee or black tea?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was only after a few days of drinking it that I realized that it tasted a bit strange. And come to think of it the color wasn’t right either. But I kept drinking it because it was Tea Time. I wanted to live the little picture on the box of cake and tea in a black pot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let us obsess over this picture. The picture’s small circular frame doesn’t show much, but what little it does suggests a whole scene. Although the framing feels somewhat incidental, the necessary elements of Tea are there: a teapot, two cups (not one), a milk pitcher, and a sugar bowl. The blue-stripe teaware is ornate yet rustic and set on a wooden table. The cake, too, straddles fanciness and simplicity. Yes, it is layered and trimmed, but one does not have to be a patisserie to make this cake, just a cook. I am tempted to say that this is colonial Tea rather than English Tea, which is not particularly surprising because this brand makes much of its being “from the founders of rooibos,” who of course were in South Africa. So the picture may be imagined as an image of how “the founders of rooibos” drank their rooibos back in 1903. Before Tick Tock came to bring us rooibos, we are to understand, there was this scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uN4xVzi56is/TY7Ohnr-zJI/AAAAAAAADGA/z2zGy-pGMWw/s1600/2230526195_7ffa733080.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uN4xVzi56is/TY7Ohnr-zJI/AAAAAAAADGA/z2zGy-pGMWw/s1600/2230526195_7ffa733080.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I’m interested in the cake. It takes up a great deal of the frame. And I can’t seem to read its three-dimensional aspect. The problem is the top, which looks like icing, except that it has these strange dark swirls in it, and the top edge is irregular. So perhaps it’s a very fluffy topping, like a meringue. Except that while the left edge and the shape of the top edge suggests that the cake is sloping, the cut on the right shows it to be straight. But if the top of the cake is flat, why are there dark swirls, and why is the top edge irregular rather than smooth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than anything else, though, I want to know what kind of cake this is. Because obviously whoever painted this must have had a type of cake he or she was painting. All I can say is that it is yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it’s time to make a yellow cake and drink rooibos brewed from loose leaves, longing for my longing for Tea.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/03/rooibos.html' title='Rooibos'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6801652893956719608/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/03/rooibos.html#comment-form' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6801652893956719608'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6801652893956719608'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/03/rooibos.html' title='Rooibos'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9icHWnB9y2E/TY7QZjkfLtI/AAAAAAAADGQ/ThmOdcl_0QQ/s72-c/IMG_0582.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4154746371519888341</id><published>2011-03-21T21:11:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:59:15.981-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Caramelized Onion Tart</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rOUYNmPFTng/TYgdDKxIMLI/AAAAAAAADFg/foV6qii-Gb4/s1600/IMG_0572.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rOUYNmPFTng/TYgdDKxIMLI/AAAAAAAADFg/foV6qii-Gb4/s200/IMG_0572.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;3 large onions&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3 tablespoons olive oil&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;pinch of salt&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1 tablespoon brown sugar&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1 tablespoon lemon juice&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1 tablespoon tamari&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2 tablespoons water&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1 unbaked tart shell&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1lG4ghSUDw0/TYgdDISOreI/AAAAAAAADFk/cU3-3pYmth8/s1600/IMG_0575.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1lG4ghSUDw0/TYgdDISOreI/AAAAAAAADFk/cU3-3pYmth8/s200/IMG_0575.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Slice onions radially into slices roughly 1/2 inch wide at their widest point. In a large saucepan on medium-high heat, fry onions with olive oil,&amp;nbsp;brown sugar,&amp;nbsp;salt, and black pepper. Mix to coat onions with oil. Stir and scrape pan every few minutes, allowing the onions to brown between stirring. After roughly ten minutes reduce heat to medium. After roughly another twenty minutes reduce heat to medium-low. It's not important to be exact about these timings; the important thing is to have the heat at such a point that it deeply browns but does not quite blacken the onions. As the onions brown and reduce, they burn more easily. When they're mostly dark brown, add lemon juice, tamari, and water, and scrape pan thoroughly with spatula to deglaze. Remove from heat. Spread caramelized onions evenly in tart shell. Bake at 400 F for ~30min.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-s20CUjMCWZs/TYgdDQYTXEI/AAAAAAAADFo/bwDw6KNgs6g/s1600/IMG_0578.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-s20CUjMCWZs/TYgdDQYTXEI/AAAAAAAADFo/bwDw6KNgs6g/s400/IMG_0578.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/03/caramelized-onion-tart.html' title='Caramelized Onion Tart'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/4154746371519888341/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/03/caramelized-onion-tart.html#comment-form' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4154746371519888341'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4154746371519888341'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/03/caramelized-onion-tart.html' title='Caramelized Onion Tart'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rOUYNmPFTng/TYgdDKxIMLI/AAAAAAAADFg/foV6qii-Gb4/s72-c/IMG_0572.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-2344326408913495563</id><published>2011-03-18T09:47:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:59:15.967-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>A Particularly Rough Day in the Life of a Saucepan</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TkR6eILe99w/TYOI_9aj_OI/AAAAAAAADEk/FhpdIMw2lRc/s1600/IMG_0542.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TkR6eILe99w/TYOI_9aj_OI/AAAAAAAADEk/FhpdIMw2lRc/s200/IMG_0542.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Sometimes, I wish I could taste. Almost every day I'm filled with substances that my owners find flavorful. And sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be them. But I know that it is their place to taste, and mine to hold and to heat. Well, no, I don't actually heat--something else heats me and I heat the things my owners eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have my good days, and I have my bad days. It's hard to know which are which. There are the days I luxuriate in the darkness of the cupboard, and days I reach a several hundred degrees, containing fireworks of oil and water within my walls. Of course, there are those times I'm left in the sink filled with grime and water for hours or days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jaN5g7v4qFE/TYOJAamDP1I/AAAAAAAADEs/WEK1gQbb-GA/s1600/IMG_0547.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jaN5g7v4qFE/TYOJAamDP1I/AAAAAAAADEs/WEK1gQbb-GA/s200/IMG_0547.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Today was nuts. I was not in the sink an hour before being scraped clean in a rush and thrown back onto the heat. It takes some time for me to warm up. My owner threw slabs of butter onto my surface, and I turned them to golden puddles. I don't normally melt butter at this temperature. It was bit invigorating. Sugar weighed down on me. This is why I'm made of metal, and not, say, paper. A paste of sugar and butter scraped me like sand as he mixed it. But it takes something much worse than sugar to actually scratch me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CWKByLPQTXU/TYOJAnCzEeI/AAAAAAAADEw/dNzkfn0xEVM/s1600/IMG_0550.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CWKByLPQTXU/TYOJAnCzEeI/AAAAAAAADEw/dNzkfn0xEVM/s200/IMG_0550.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;There were apples, too. It all became molten soon enough. Wet apples clung to my surface and, cringing, I burnt them. At such moments I feel a pang of regret and anger at myself or at my owner, I can't say which. It is his neglect but my flesh. I got the feeling he was being especially negligent today, because rather than carefully maintaining the arrangement of apple pieces held within me, the spatula was flung every which way as he mixed them into a messy pile. Beside me I heard the frantic motions of a rolling pin. It did not take long for the molten sugar to begin to burn. There is something in the way it bubbles that gives it away. Atop me he threw brown scraps of dough like the ad-hoc furs of some barbarian. Most of the gaps were closed before I was thrown in the oven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nydnhFf92rA/TYOJAxNwXgI/AAAAAAAADE0/SovQka4JJ9s/s1600/IMG_0553.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nydnhFf92rA/TYOJAxNwXgI/AAAAAAAADE0/SovQka4JJ9s/s200/IMG_0553.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Waiting in the oven is different than the usual kinds of waiting I do--waiting in the cupboard, waiting in the sink--because, like him outside in the kitchen, I am anticipating being removed from the oven. In the cupboard and in the sink I don't get so anxious because I know I could be there for a long time. I'm never in the oven for very long, though I never know exactly how long. I keep wondering if the crust is browned enough, if he will be satisfied with how the crust looks. He opened the oven at least a dozen times during my stint in the oven this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hT9CjLBFUO0/TYOJBR0K7ZI/AAAAAAAADE4/43gvo28qGaE/s1600/IMG_0556.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hT9CjLBFUO0/TYOJBR0K7ZI/AAAAAAAADE4/43gvo28qGaE/s200/IMG_0556.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;When he finally did take me out, he ran a knife along my walls, as he usually does, to detach the crust. I do wish he would find a better way to flip me over. It makes me nervous being spun about like that, although honestly at some level I hope he does slip, drop everything including me (I'm metal, I can take it), and spill burning tart all over him. But yet again, he didn't. He did burn himself on my handle though. I suppose you could say I burned him. But really, he should've known better. I wonder why he's so clumsy today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, just a quick scrub and I was put back at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BTO3P_tcZYs/TYOJBpB6LMI/AAAAAAAADE8/L2NknWiHUC4/s1600/IMG_0558.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BTO3P_tcZYs/TYOJBpB6LMI/AAAAAAAADE8/L2NknWiHUC4/s200/IMG_0558.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nxnN3bFhZis/TYOJCGy-a3I/AAAAAAAADFA/rMPWd4sIMYo/s1600/IMG_0565.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nxnN3bFhZis/TYOJCGy-a3I/AAAAAAAADFA/rMPWd4sIMYo/s200/IMG_0565.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;As the ripping sounds of vegetables being sliced apart reverberated through my metal curvature, I became increasingly hot. Oil slipped across me, pooling on one side. This is why I have walls. My owner dropped the sliced vegetables onto me, and I made them sizzle. I could feel them slumping and sweating against me. What does a shallot taste like? A heap of broccoli interrupted my speculations. He didn't let the shallots develop their flavor, he was hasty. He usually leaves onions, which are similar enough to shallots, sauteeing for much longer. He was acting strangely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-L_knsuWMTwY/TYOJCULnYAI/AAAAAAAADFE/MiysQLMbdq4/s1600/IMG_0567.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-L_knsuWMTwY/TYOJCULnYAI/AAAAAAAADFE/MiysQLMbdq4/s200/IMG_0567.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The vinegar and olive brine barely touched me, becoming puffs of steam on contact. He covered me up, trapping clouds in my interior. Water collected in droplets inside my cover, and streamed down the sides. More water was splashed in from a cup, and more. Vapour spat out my sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flour he sprinkled in just turned to tiny lumps. My task was basically done, then just a container into which more was dumped: shrimp, salt, pasta. For a moment he slides me back onto the heat, but takes me off again. That's it. I've been left in the fridge ever since. I'm used to waiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2xOcmuOcyws/TYOJDZdaiSI/AAAAAAAADFM/AXfCrNrDjD8/s1600/IMG_0571.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2xOcmuOcyws/TYOJDZdaiSI/AAAAAAAADFM/AXfCrNrDjD8/s200/IMG_0571.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/03/particularly-rough-day-in-life-of.html' title='A Particularly Rough Day in the Life of a Saucepan'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/2344326408913495563/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/03/a-particularly-rough-day-in-life-of.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2344326408913495563'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2344326408913495563'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/03/a-particularly-rough-day-in-life-of.html' title='A Particularly Rough Day in the Life of a Saucepan'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TkR6eILe99w/TYOI_9aj_OI/AAAAAAAADEk/FhpdIMw2lRc/s72-c/IMG_0542.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-6611482706664643107</id><published>2011-03-15T11:36:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:59:15.997-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Caramelized Onion, Olive, and Mozzarella Tart</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-sIrqlDr9ttc/TX8ZtScrijI/AAAAAAAADEE/ADb8YFHc7no/s1600/IMG_0536.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-sIrqlDr9ttc/TX8ZtScrijI/AAAAAAAADEE/ADb8YFHc7no/s320/IMG_0536.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This tart went from whatever to tantalizing to whatever. I wanted to make it because I wanted to write a blog post about it. But I soon became interested in the process of making it although I was not particularly looking forward to the result. Chopping and cooking the onions helped me think; the world became spacious with the sound of frying onions. But I was not salivating yet. That happened when I put the assembled tart in the oven. I &lt;i&gt;wanted&lt;/i&gt; to eat it. I rejoiced: this was an achievement. Was it as good as I anticipated? No, not really. Too much of too thick of a still somewhat doughy crust. The whole thing was just ridiculously heavy, and I thought the cheese actually detracted from the caramelized onions. And I’m not sure the olives were necessary. If I made this again I would use four onions instead of two for the same size tart, I would not use whole wheat pastry flour in the crust (I ran out of all-purpose flour), and I would not add olives or mozzarella. And wine might be a nice addition. Or something else a little fruity. Maybe tomatoes, or even apples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In the morning the cheese has hardened into a tough, dry scab. This tart has a very short shelf life; it lasts from the time it begins baking until it’s tasted.  But I nibble on the caramelized onions, which never needed to be packaged and garnished at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-fjbwAkXu_Qk/TX8ZsRA3hrI/AAAAAAAADD4/6Ez9NbXKCVc/s1600/IMG_0528.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-fjbwAkXu_Qk/TX8ZsRA3hrI/AAAAAAAADD4/6Ez9NbXKCVc/s400/IMG_0528.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/03/caramelized-onion-olive-and-mozzarella.html' title='Caramelized Onion, Olive, and Mozzarella Tart'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6611482706664643107/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/03/caramelized-onion-olive-and-mozzarella.html#comment-form' title='7 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6611482706664643107'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6611482706664643107'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/03/caramelized-onion-olive-and-mozzarella.html' title='Caramelized Onion, Olive, and Mozzarella Tart'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-sIrqlDr9ttc/TX8ZtScrijI/AAAAAAAADEE/ADb8YFHc7no/s72-c/IMG_0536.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-3793293031371932348</id><published>2011-03-10T15:03:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:59:15.979-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>7th Annual Oregon Chocolate Festival</title><content type='html'>Booths, whether they are in a market or in an event, whether selling food, trinkets, or political causes, have always frightened me. I think this has to do with how supermarkets taught me to approach transactions. In a supermarket, the closest one comes to interacting with the seller is in the checkout line, and there the cashier hardly cares what one buys. I have a feeling of relative freedom in a supermarket because nobody is watching me, or at least only a very general someone. I am just one among many customers in the store at any given moment, and no employee is really in charge of the place; they just work there. In a small shop, on the other hand, I find myself running toward some secluded corner first, to collect myself before, if i have to, making the foray to where I can be seen. There is nothing keeping the employee or proprietor of a small shop from being interested in whatever I’m doing, even though, in all likelihood, they are not interested. Booths are the worst: everything I do can be seen, and we might even chat about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I see booths I think of the two open markets that happen weekly in Ashland’s warmer months.  Markets of this sort in the U.S. today are part of a more general trend of rejecting bits of postwar capitalism in favor of The Way Things Used to Be, or taking the Old World to the New. The boons of the 1950s have become the horrors of the new millennium: processed foods are bad, supermarkets distance us from our neighbors, agricultural technologies are poisonous. The list goes on, and each horror has given rise to a burgeoning alternative. Although some of them are more &lt;a href="http://www.farmboat.org/about/"&gt;nostalgic museum pieces&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;than anything else, these are all good things, I think. But even if the rigors of economics accept them, I’m not sure I entirely can. The mores of the supermarket have been encoded into my being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I discovered that the chocolate tasting part of the Chocolate Festival consisted in visiting a bunch of chocolate vendor’s booths, I was scared. What was I to say? How was this interaction supposed to happen? How could I approach the booth without its occupants noticing? Would they be annoyed that I obviously wanted to eat their samples and nothing more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clung to the water spigot, downing draughts of ice water as if it were booze and I were drinking courage. Then I began walking around and around trying to work up the nerve to approach a booth. I was grateful for the vendors who, without preamble, thrust chocolatey things into my hands. Sometimes there were conversational spielers who asked me questions, brave souls. Not trusting my capacity to keep up my end of the talk, I would flee from these when first possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One time my flight led me up the hotel’s stairs, trying to distance myself from the festival, only to reencounter it. There was some sort of barely polite spat between a chocolatier, or maybe a chocolate company representative, saying that the Chocolate Festival screwed up the description of his company. Or something. Or it was put in the wrong category. Or he entered it into the wrong category, and thus lost the contest. Part of the Chocolate Festival is a judged chocolate contest. It’s a big hullaballoo, I imagine. He called the mistake “very embarrassing for me.” They argued for ten minutes, saying the same things over and over, while I sat on the stairs a floor above them. Nothing could be done, there was nothing he seemed to want or could want other than to let them know that they will never be forgiven. And the staff he was bitching at, in turn, could only apologize for their alleged error, and self-justify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But down the stairs among the booths, any dissonance between chocolatiers and festival is invisible. In the end it is largely self-destructive to try to signal one’s dissatisfaction with the means of enunciation one is given. Although occasionally it can be quite lucrative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow, despite my skittishness, I managed to make my way to each booth. Well, I was guided through the gauntlet by a Chocolate Festival veteran. She said she has “plenty of taste but no standards.” This also describes my relationship with chocolate rather well. I am by no means a connoisseur, but some things I sampled at the festival, for whatever reason, I reacted viscerally to. Everything there tasted like chocolate--well, okay, the raw chocolate didn’t quite--but some things surprised me. Some of the most memorable bites follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were the delightfully gooey, dark truffles from &lt;a href="http://www.bransonschocolates.com/"&gt;Branson’s Chocolates&lt;/a&gt;. I completely agree with their purveyor who said that’s how she likes ‘em, disdaining the stiff variety of truffles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was &lt;a href="http://www.lilliebellefarms.com/"&gt;Lillie Belle Farms&lt;/a&gt;’gorgonzola chocolate spread. Contrary to their cute purple logo, they revel in trendy chocolate juxtapositions. There was chocolate with bacon, chocolate with tons of hot chili, and chocolate with local gorgonzola cheese. This last was like milk chocolate, but sharp with mold and saltiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we move on to the weird and the nonchocolate. Linda Shumate of &lt;a href="http://premrosedibles.com/"&gt;PremRose Edibles&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;was quite insistent on having everyone try her rose preserves. “It’s like eating rose water,” I said, which she seemed to find somewhat insulting. ”Which one?” I think she thought I was humoring her and that I hated the stuff, but actually I love it. It is a piece of high confectionary (or in the parlance of this blog, “&lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2011/01/pastrys-conspiracy.html"&gt;pastry&lt;/a&gt;”) to simmer down enough rose petals to create a heavily perfumed preserve. Or whatever is done with the rose petals. I’m ignorant as to how it’s made. I imagine the arcane, perverse chemistry of &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0396171/"&gt;“Perfume”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally there was &lt;a href="http://www.zorbasrawchocolates.com/"&gt;Zorba’s&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;raw chocolate green tea ginger truffle, which is as much a mouthful in taste as its name. It was more than visceral. It eviscerated. Its green powdery coating puckered my mouth with intense bitterness. It tasted not of confectionary but of medicine, and made me feel like I had been given an inebriating dose of healthfulness. I felt dizzy. It was spectacularly awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a lot of raw chocolatiers at the festival. Jen Moore at the &lt;a href="http://www.jemrawchocolate.com/"&gt;Jem Chocolates&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;booth was chatty. “Have you ever experienced raw chocolate before?” she asked as I chewed on my sample. Of course. I should have guessed that one doesn’t have, taste, or try raw chocolate, one &lt;i&gt;experiences&lt;/i&gt; it. She went on to tell me that raw chocolate is rich in nutrients. I blinked. Silly me, eating chocolate for pleasure. Roasting chocolate brings out the tannins she said, and hides the nuttiness of raw chocolate. She was one I eventually fled from. It turned out later that my ambivalence was as visible as I had feared. The second time I found myself there she said I (unwittingly) gave “good feedback.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I think, unlike booths, I dislike raw chocolate on principle. Every raw chocolatier seems to deal in the discourse of Truth. Processing and cooking chocolate corrupts its true healthful nature and noble flavor, turning it sour with tannins. I do find raw chocolate’s flavor refreshing in contrast to conventional chocolate’s intensity, but raw chocolatiers seem eager to take the word ‘raw’ literally and convince us that it’s better because it’s &lt;i&gt;more real&lt;/i&gt;.  Maybe I don’t understand because I just haven’t put enough effort into overcoming my entrenchment in industrial comforts. Maybe if I &lt;a href="http://www.theblissbar.org/about-us.html"&gt;wrapped my head in hand-spun cloth, dressed entirely in Indian imports, renamed myself, and converted to Sikhism (in that order and not the reverse)&lt;/a&gt;, I too would feel raw chocolate’s goodness.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/03/7th-annual-oregon-chocolate-festival.html' title='7th Annual Oregon Chocolate Festival'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/3793293031371932348/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/03/7th-annual-oregon-chocolate-festival.html#comment-form' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3793293031371932348'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3793293031371932348'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/03/7th-annual-oregon-chocolate-festival.html' title='7th Annual Oregon Chocolate Festival'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-7561134181403445495</id><published>2011-03-09T21:46:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:59:16.006-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Brown Sticky Asparagus</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;~24 asparagus stalks&lt;br /&gt;2 cloves garlic&lt;br /&gt;3 tablespoons butter&lt;br /&gt;3 tablespoons maple syrup&lt;br /&gt;1 tablespoon soy sauce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smash garlic cloves, peel, and then chop finely. Chop off hard ends of asparagus stalks (~2in?). Melt butter in large saucepan with a thick bottom on medium-high heat. Throw in garlic and fry until golden brown. Remove garlic to a small bowl, keeping as much butter in saucepan as possible. Pour maple syrup and soy sauce into small bowl and stir together. Begin frying asparagus in saucepan. Coat well with butter. Stir every two minutes. The goal is to get them brown or charred on as many sides as possible, and to cook them until soft. Once they are soft enough to your liking, pour in liquid mixture, remove from heat, and stir asparagus around to coat them.

Because we are sitting down to a nice chat, and you’re the most indulgent listener ever, just dying to hear whatever half-baked spiel that crawls out of my mouth. You see, dear reader, for the most part making food happens out of desperation for me. I am horrible at planning ahead, and when I’m busy as I have been recently, I do the cognitive equivalent of grabbing whatever is within reach. Or I literally grab the nearest things in the kitchen. At such times, some basic forms of cookery are necessary frames to keep it all from getting too unmanageable both mentally and logistically. The past two days indicate that apparently I have at least two such shortcuts on hand: make soup of leftovers, or throw things in the oven. Probably I don’t have them on hand or in head at all, but somehow, thankfully, they happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-O97dfAuv2cI/TXCm06WDLkI/AAAAAAAAC9Q/AdY168h-Mgc/s1600/IMG_0502.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-O97dfAuv2cI/TXCm06WDLkI/AAAAAAAAC9Q/AdY168h-Mgc/s400/IMG_0502.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-b9rC8pUvjHU/TXCm1f0dghI/AAAAAAAAC9U/ccm4-jm6zZM/s1600/IMG_0505.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-b9rC8pUvjHU/TXCm1f0dghI/AAAAAAAAC9U/ccm4-jm6zZM/s200/IMG_0505.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Soup is probably the most well-trod way of using up leftovers. A lot of various things suddenly become commensurate when thrown in a pot of water or stock. I made soup of leftovers because I saw refried beans, fried kale, cooked ground beef, half an onion, a tortilla, and some mushrooms in the fridge, and I thought “soup!” And of course because it’s me, before any water came into the picture I browned onions, mushrooms, and garlic in some oil. And there was quite a bit of chili powder. And some possibly ill-advised cumin. (I couldn’t help but think of the&lt;a href="http://www.planetclaire.org/quotes/gossipgirl/season-two/remains-of-the-j.php"&gt; overpowering odor&lt;/a&gt; of Rufus’s chili.) I know, these details outside of a recipe have you rapt, don’t they? Little did you know I’m trying to snuff you out in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pedant-Shuffly-John-Bellairs/dp/1887726071"&gt;a blizzard of Irrelevant Facts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FDQ19tm7osQ/TXCm1gExspI/AAAAAAAAC9Y/2mdrsQMpDu4/s1600/IMG_0507.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FDQ19tm7osQ/TXCm1gExspI/AAAAAAAAC9Y/2mdrsQMpDu4/s200/IMG_0507.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A tangent: I actually have no clue what I’m doing when it comes to seasonings. (Or, well, anything really, but seasonings especially.) I am either falling into strange habits, experimenting blindly, or being minimalist (salt, pepper). The thing is, I only understand how flavors go with other flavors in the negative. If I’m putting things together I’m thinking &lt;i&gt;sure, I guess this might taste good together, maybe&lt;/i&gt;. But suggest to me a combination and often you’ll get a response of “ew,” or an extremely ill-masked dubious look. I apologize for this particular knee-jerk of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-swJlEdHLt9o/TXCm2e1OEWI/AAAAAAAAC9c/fKwAfabX480/s1600/IMG_0508.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-swJlEdHLt9o/TXCm2e1OEWI/AAAAAAAAC9c/fKwAfabX480/s400/IMG_0508.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gvQyQbh7D64/TXCm2oaICAI/AAAAAAAAC9g/6S6IjwKAwSo/s1600/IMG_0509.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gvQyQbh7D64/TXCm2oaICAI/AAAAAAAAC9g/6S6IjwKAwSo/s200/IMG_0509.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Anyway, throwing stuff in the oven seems initially like a wonderfully lazy option. But I always end up babying the stuff. Tonight the stuff was pork chops, onion, red pepper, and mushrooms. Pork chops cook quickly, apparently, because they were done in about half an hour, at which point I thought &lt;i&gt;nooo they must be browned!&lt;/i&gt; and turned the oven to broil for five minutes. Then I put them on a plate, and continued to bake the soupy vegetables. Of course, I may as well have put them in a pan on the stove for all the stirring I did. Must’ve opened the oven five or six times. The problem was that the vegetables released a lot of water, thus stewing the pork chops rather than roasting them, and thus no sear. Maybe pork chops roasted with vegetables is just not to be. The only viable method I can think of is to suspend the poor things on a wire rack above the roasting vegetables, and basting them in the vegetable juice a few times. But that just sounds wayyy to involved. Although it can’t really be more involved than what I did this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Pkppk5J-ZTw/TXCm23DKFzI/AAAAAAAAC9k/L-lootm4jDs/s1600/IMG_0510.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Pkppk5J-ZTw/TXCm23DKFzI/AAAAAAAAC9k/L-lootm4jDs/s400/IMG_0510.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, no recipe. Come on, you don’t really want a recipe for Soupy, Overcooked Pork Chops With Roasted Vegetable Topping, do you?  There was once a time when this blog was about perfecting techniques and recipes. It has since devolved into me babbling about whatever the hell I feel like, sometimes connecting it to what I happened to have cooked recently. The defining change is that intentionality has left. I no longer cook things to post them on my blog. I cook what I cook, and sometimes take photos to keep the possibility of blogging about it open.

It’s ideal because there aren’t many distractions and because there is no actual page upon which what I’ve written is visible. It is possible to crystalize by editing and editing, without really having to edit anything because nothing is set down. But the problem with composing things of any length in your head like this is that they never come out onto the page as you’d hoped. For one thing, it’s very easy to forget what you never actually wrote. Writing in general is not much different; composing in the mind rather than on the page just delays the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes writing this blog is a pain. It has to be thought about (tragic, I know). It’s not anything like, say, Alicia in “The Good Wife” typing out an additional argument to a Legal Aid appeal in 48 minutes with a crowd looking over her shoulder and talking over each other to give her information. It is at least somewhat believable that one could actually do such a thing because the form and content of the document would be largely, I imagine, determined in advance. (Law students, correct me on this?) This blog, on the other hand, while it has vaguely defined a genre for itself, has not really settled into a consistent form, and its content often comes from intangible sources. Generally I just cook something, take a few harried photos, and hope that something a little bit interesting will suddenly befall me when I finally sit down to write about it. Often coming up with something to say about whatever I’ve cooked means writing in the most over-the-top way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what tires me about this blog is not the actual writing. It's that sometimes when I cook I think &lt;i&gt;must I really think about what I’m doing?&lt;/i&gt; One of the pleasures of cooking, to me, is losing myself in a nonlinguistic activity. If I’m to post about what I’m cooking, not only do I probably have to take mental notes on techniques and measurements of ingredients, but I have to (well, okay, I want to) think of some way to frame the post other than “I cooked this. It was interesting. Some things went well and others did not.” This turns cooking into a queer experience: I have to create the frame and be within it at the same time. I get tired of being in-frame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be making a mistake in, well, framing the problem this way. While being split between inside and outside, observer and actor may be awkward, is there really any time when one isn’t?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced the fatigue of framing in another way, through photography, in which there is literally a frame.     I always say that I got tired of photography because I didn’t like that my vision was turned constantly into a search for a good composition. The problem as I saw it was that whether I not I had a camera, photography never really went away. Photography was a scene of anxiety: I didn’t want to miss an opportunity for a good photo. This put me in a very odd relationship with the passage of time. While every new moment afforded the possibility of a photo, I didn’t want each moment to pass because even when I took a photo to record the moment I was never sure it was the right photo. But I think what I ultimately ascribed my dislike of photography to was how it demanded that I objectify my visual experience. Things seen were there for one purpose: to be photographed. From inside my photographer’s gaze, I felt that this collapsed the experience of seeing. My complaint was that I didn’t want to see for a purpose, I wanted to just see.&amp;nbsp;I wanted out.&amp;nbsp;There is something paradoxical about this. In the politically naive way I approached photograph  y, it was the most purposeless way of seeing possible. It created a fascination with form for form’s sake. But this purposeless seeing, I thought, became unbearably purposive. So I stopped, and considered myself free from the frame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My idea regarding both cooking for a blog post and photography, I suppose, is that there’s a great blossoming of depth and complexity when I step out of my framing mechanisms. The problem is that this blossoming can only be felt in relation to what I want to distance myself from. So a few nights ago when I made dinner and I thought how sick I was of this blog business, I had a nice, peaceful time cooking. Cooking can be a good time to reflect in a non-deliberate way on things other than cooking. And while cooking my world consists of more than cognition; I feel, smell, and taste ingredients. But because I insist on an ill-defined idea of “the grass is always greener,” I have to wonder if what I liked about the experience was any positive feature at all, but rather what it was not. It was not a cooking experience destined for a blog post. (And here I am writing about it.) I liked the way the distance from blogging felt. It felt like privacy, which is not something that can be felt on its own; one can only feel private &lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt; some form of visibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facebook is a massive nexus of transparency. It’s monstrous, and turns its users into monsters. We are there to be seen and to peer at others. Thus not posting anything on Facebook feels like privacy. But if there were no Facebook, I could not have privacy from it. And it produces privacy in another way: you may show all sorts of things about your life there, and yet live outside of your publicity. You may live bits and pieces of a private life because it is so publicized. Similarly, because I write a blog that is largely about my life, I am afforded privacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If I say “privacy” one more time you’re going to kill me, aren’t you?)</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/02/cooking-blogger-nondilemma.html' title='The Cooking Blogger&amp;#39;s Nondilemma'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/4814178153665188957/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/02/the-cooking-blogger-nondilemma.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4814178153665188957'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4814178153665188957'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/02/the-cooking-blogger-nondilemma.html' title='The Cooking Blogger&amp;#39;s Nondilemma'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-3202657167477182272</id><published>2011-02-22T12:00:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T17:59:15.973-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Pankeggs (and American Breakfasts)</title><content type='html'>The older I get, the more finicky I become about breakfast. Mostly I poke at it, trying my best to take seriously what only seems like an abstract need for food in the morning. The food often seems too rich, like it’s trying to &lt;i&gt;feed&lt;/i&gt; me. Awfully presumptuous of it, don’t you think? Breakfasts in American restaurants are the most offensive in this regard. Their menus full of terrifying practicality, like every customer is in a state of emergency and has got to GET SOME FOOD IN THERE, stat. They don’t waste time on trivial things that aren’t dense with protein, fat, and carbohydrates. And they would never dream of skimping; they err on the side of making you explode. Don’t they understand that breakfast is a time of nausea? It’s in the name. Following a fast, one does not gorge oneself on bacon, eggs, butter, potatoes, and coffee. One might be very hungry, but one needs to ease into the fact of eating. One needs to be seduced. The purveyors of American breakfasts seem completely ignorant of the erotics of eating. To consider the mediative process by which food gets from plate to stomach would be, what, too French?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I know, I just romanticized Frenchness. Sigh.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, this morning I made &lt;a href="http://chewonthat.blogspot.com/2007/06/pankegg.html"&gt;pankegg&lt;/a&gt;. It’s one of those gimmicky breakfast foods that fuses a fried egg with some starchy substrate. Actually I can only think of two such foods: egg-in-a-hole and pankegg. Yeah, alright, so maybe it’s not a whole genre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Pancakes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 egg&lt;br /&gt;~3/4 cup milk&lt;br /&gt;2/3 cup whole wheat pastry flour&lt;br /&gt;2 teaspoons vegetable oil&lt;br /&gt;pinch of salt&lt;br /&gt;1 teaspoon baking powder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Pankeggs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 more eggs, one for each pancake&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a medium bowl combine egg, milk, and oil. Add flour, baking powder, and salt. Thoroughly whisk everything together. Let stand for five minutes while the pan heats on medium heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil the pan.&amp;nbsp;Pour pancake onto pan. When there are lots of bubbles, remove it to a plate, uncooked side up. Crack an egg into the center of the pan. Immediately place the pancake on top of this, uncooked side down. Cook for a few minutes, so that the yolk in still runny. Serve egg side up. Repeat for remainder of pancake batter (should make 3).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FXhehW65Rfo/TWQOzZXFX1I/AAAAAAAAC3g/xflADwLv3sY/s1600/IMG_0476.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FXhehW65Rfo/TWQOzZXFX1I/AAAAAAAAC3g/xflADwLv3sY/s400/IMG_0476.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Match cut to the second to last photo?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-D76mG5mrNaE/TWQOzgCYjUI/AAAAAAAAC3k/ER2NRvxSToI/s1600/IMG_0477.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-D76mG5mrNaE/TWQOzgCYjUI/AAAAAAAAC3k/ER2NRvxSToI/s400/IMG_0477.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;There isn't roughly 3/4 cup milk like the recipe says.

I always cooked and ate them separately--quinoa as a kind of hot grain salad, and kidney beans as a thick soup. Today I decided to make a meal of combining the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This being a "pantry cleanse" (a term I've lifted from "&lt;a href="http://www.lifeinrecipes.com/2011/01/pantry-cleanse-brown-rice-beet-risotto.html"&gt;life, in recipes&lt;/a&gt;"), all of the ingredients are incidental. Each has a particular history of how it ended up in the kitchen. Because my father has a tendency to buy food as if we are preparing for the end times, we have an entire case of canned kidney beans, and a giant bag of quinoa. There are those things that I habitually buy and see as necessities: onions, cooking oil, salt, chili powder. I bought the green onions because they were on sale and I thought they might encourage me to improvise. My brother and I got a yellow beet and carrots for a salad some time ago. I don’t remember why we had mushrooms and jalapenos--for some other meal. Inexplicably we have what to me is an enormous quantity of saffron. I really don’t know what to do with it. I put it in all sorts of things, thinking that I’ll taste it, but I don’t. Its subtle flavor eludes me. In imitation of some kind of aromatic rice dish, I used it in the quinoa, along with some cloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidental food is a topic that I have talked too much about, but I think insufficiently. Sure, there are recipes, like this one, that come about incidentally. But what I want to talk about is how it’s a deceiving accident of idiom that one &lt;i&gt;makes&lt;/i&gt; food. What I want to say amounts, basically, to an “in Soviet Russia” joke: food makes you! There are several reasons for this. As much as the ingredient lists of some recipes would have us believe supermarkets are infinities of choice, there are        in fact items that are not available.  Foods are varying levels of affordable in different places. We are habituated to certain kinds of foods and preparation methods. And most importantly, food is woven into our social lives, our families, and our psychology. Maybe your mother tries to dictate what you eat. You may not necessary follow all or even any of her commands, but nonetheless your gustatory life becomes defined by them, by her. Maybe you live with your grandmother, and she only has certain scare items in the kitchen. Maybe your crazy landlord lives and sleeps in the kitchen, and you want to limit your time there as much as possible. Maybe you live at home with your father who impulsively buys an assortment of food that you feel compelled to use before it perishes. And maybe you’re a cheapskate and want to eat as much of the odd items laying around the kitchen as possible, buying only very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nigella Lawson talks about culinary agency with a turn of phrase that I like, “greedy opportunism.” Of course there’s more than a little contrivance in her usage. Greedy opportunism is the process of gadding about in her shining kitchen picking out gourmet goodies that just &lt;i&gt;happened&lt;/i&gt; to find their way there, and relishing some new use for them. It is as if she has an infestation of pantry-stocking gremlins. But while it is a class-charged way to frame her show, it’s also one way that improvisation in cooking happens: things you don’t necessarily have a planned use for will end up in your kitchen; use them somehow. At least half of what I cook is through greedy opportunism. Although I must admit that only rarely is it greedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-akqxXVtZCvw/TVs5S8fW6lI/AAAAAAAAC2E/-kDSOJFHK8s/s1600/IMG_0459.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-akqxXVtZCvw/TVs5S8fW6lI/AAAAAAAAC2E/-kDSOJFHK8s/s200/IMG_0459.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;Beans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;2 12oz cans kidney beans&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;2/3 cup water&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;1 onion&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;4 mushrooms&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;1/2 carrot&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;1/4 yellow beet&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;1 clove garlic&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;1/2 jalapeno&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;1 tablespoon cooking oil&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;1/2 teaspoon chili powder&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;1/2 teaspoon salt&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Chop onion 1cm square.

Don't stir more often because the mushrooms won't brown. Stir in kidney beans and water.

For someone who writes a blog about food I have remarkably little enthusiasm for eating.  I push away my plate, content more with the freedom from having to eat I have just won. Eating is often merely a distasteful means to an end. Maybe this is because I read &lt;i&gt;In The Night Kitchen&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;over and over as a child. Or perhaps I read it over and over because in some way it spoke to my tendency toward disgust. In either case the book is certainly related in some way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is actually a convincing case to be made for the latter possibility that I have always been prone to rejecting food. As a very small child, I am told (I don’t remember this), I went so far as to pick the bowl off of my highchair and throw it at my parents. They were the oppressors who had introduced this cruel new economy into my life: to survive you must eat. I rejected it as a theory for as long it was possible to do so. The doctor worried. My parents worried and, hoping that the problem was merely an uncontrollable enthusiasm for throwing food at them, bought a bowl with suction cups. Somehow, I managed to throw this new bowl at them too. Their idea of why I did this remained unchallenged. But today I am convinced that I did not just take pleasure in throwing things at them (though I’m sure I did). I think that I was appalled by the notion that this stuff in the bowl had to go into my mouth, and moreover that I had to make it do so. No more were the good old days of breastfeeding and bottles. I’m sure I’m getting the chronology wrong somehow, but after a rather extended period of drinking from a bottle, I chucked it into a trashcan myself, in a symbolic gesture full of melodrama. I didn’t know at the time what I had just gotten myself into. My will to self-determination was propped up by the idea that beyond the bottle lay not just dignity, but freedom. Nobody ever told me that I would have to &lt;i&gt;eat&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a way my childhood fast is the very height of heroism, and in its extremity reveals heroism’s absurdity. Here is heroism: one stands between a reality and a truth and throws a fit. I would deal with primal loss by viewing the world with skepticism and occasionally denying its vicissitudes altogether. I would not accept eating as my access to the good stuff. No, it was just some new shit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mickey of &lt;i&gt;In The Night Kitchen&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;has a much less problematic relationship with, um, milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LVxPUgUdST0/TViXDQctgHI/AAAAAAAACzg/5Jsr_p3i3p0/s1600/in_the_night_kitchen003.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="309" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LVxPUgUdST0/TViXDQctgHI/AAAAAAAACzg/5Jsr_p3i3p0/s320/in_the_night_kitchen003.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Among other things,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;In the Night Kitchen&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the story&amp;nbsp;of Mickey's nakedness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qS6sTzvyzTc/TViXDxD7QdI/AAAAAAAACzo/TsuCv3mkqQw/s1600/in_the_night_kitchen008.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qS6sTzvyzTc/TViXDxD7QdI/AAAAAAAACzo/TsuCv3mkqQw/s320/in_the_night_kitchen008.jpg" width="186" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Mickey falls into the night kitchen under&amp;nbsp;a mistaken identity: milk. Yes, that is his hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZtkQgnIZITA/TViXEVX3-5I/AAAAAAAACzs/e_X2W68o7LE/s1600/in_the_night_kitchen012.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZtkQgnIZITA/TViXEVX3-5I/AAAAAAAACzs/e_X2W68o7LE/s320/in_the_night_kitchen012.jpg" width="232" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Mickey asserts his identity, his separateness from the night kitchen and its ingredients. He is not a part of their mad cake production. He is not milk. He is special. Or at least he certainly has no doubts that he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite his protestations the bakers still take him for milk, and for this reason chase after him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GL6rN9dvAO0/TViXE5YHJuI/AAAAAAAACzw/yQInWiSmguE/s1600/in_the_night_kitchen014.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GL6rN9dvAO0/TViXE5YHJuI/AAAAAAAACzw/yQInWiSmguE/s320/in_the_night_kitchen014.jpg" width="244" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;At this point he has transformed as if by magic two foods into tools for his use: a jumpsuit from the cake he was baked in, and an airplane from unbaked dough with which to evade the bakers. The bakers in fact form no real threat.&amp;nbsp;He is the master, almost effortlessly shaping all the world to his will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-g5iLqPcxBa4/TViXFRDN5iI/AAAAAAAACz0/MXrCQBKz7Eo/s1600/in_the_night_kitchen019.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-g5iLqPcxBa4/TViXFRDN5iI/AAAAAAAACz0/MXrCQBKz7Eo/s320/in_the_night_kitchen019.jpg" width="239" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Refuting that he &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; milk, he goes to &lt;i&gt;get&lt;/i&gt; milk. This is the story, then, of the formation of Mickey's masculine subject-position. I daresay it's not a coincidence that the bottle of milk is an enormous phallus and the tallest building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zsEfTGnPqAs/TViXFnJEVEI/AAAAAAAACz8/3yr9ldBdSzw/s1600/in_the_night_kitchen026.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zsEfTGnPqAs/TViXFnJEVEI/AAAAAAAACz8/3yr9ldBdSzw/s400/in_the_night_kitchen026.jpg" width="141" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;But to get milk and yet be separate from milk he must form a new relationship with the milk. Rather than being confused for milk, he and the milk interpenetrate. Distinction is just another word for friction. Interestingly he and the book celebrate this moment. To have rather than to be might necessitate objects circulating through you, but it's not a price. It's a kind of glory, it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The milk, it is worth noting, dissolves his cake-clothing. Getting the milk demands nakedness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dafj_Xh_b-g/TVijyFcfDeI/AAAAAAAAC0I/HKmLIf5V_7Q/s1600/in_the_night_kitchen031.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; display: inline !important; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="310" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dafj_Xh_b-g/TVijyFcfDeI/AAAAAAAAC0I/HKmLIf5V_7Q/s320/in_the_night_kitchen031.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Mission accomplished. Mickey relishes in his newly forged identity: he gets milk.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;This is the only red text in the book.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-I7MH43DvWUM/TViXmpLBYQI/AAAAAAAAC0A/icCBSJN4Ujk/s1600/in_the_night_kitchen033.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="165" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-I7MH43DvWUM/TViXmpLBYQI/AAAAAAAAC0A/icCBSJN4Ujk/s400/in_the_night_kitchen033.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;He is restored from nakedness to the regular world and clothedness, but now a boy. His identity is from the night kitchen is not lost, but reflected: oh to ho.

Soak florets in salt water. What does that mean? I used probably 3 teaspoons of salt. Who knows if it does anything. Finely chop jalapeno, ginger, and 2 cloves of garlic.&amp;nbsp;In a large mixing bowl combine all breading ingredients. In a small bowl combine all sauce ingredients. Chop the whites of a bunch of green onions off and chop them into roughly 5mm pieces. Fill a wok about 3/4 inch with high-temperature oil. Heat oil to ~350 F, if you have a thermometer. Otherwise try heating it for five minutes, then test it every minute or two with a dollop of breading. It should bubble a lot, and brown fairly quickly. What specifically does that mean? I don't know. In any case drain the florets thoroughly and dump them into the bowl of breading batter. Mix them around until they're evenly coated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then deep fry as many as will fit in the oil at once. Turn them over with a very long utensil every couple minutes (the oil is not deep enough to fry them evenly). Break apart any that stick together with the same long utensil. Don't let them get cuddly. When they are golden brown (is anything ever not supposed to be golden brown when it's done?), take them out with the giant utensil, without taking too much oil with them, and put them on a paper-towel-covered plate. Repeat this paragraph until there are no more florets to fry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pour the oil into a very very dry container that will not die from the sudden heat. Then pour the sesame oil in the wok. Stir fry all the ingredients under, yes, you guessed it, the "Stir Fry" title. For a few minutes. I didn't do this. I forgot. I just put the stir fry ingredients in with the sauce. Which is next: pour the sauce into the wok. Stir it constantly for about five minutes. Add a few tablespoons of water, and let it come to a boil again. Then dump in all the deep-fried florets and coat them with the sauce. The question here is: to immediately remove them from heat, or to fry them in hopes of making them crispy? I went in between, frying them for only about a minute, and they came out soggy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WtR1NcFFZxc/TVeINxcQ86I/AAAAAAAACyc/Fpp6TysaAOg/s1600/IMG_0440.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

When I say five minutes I just mean what felt like a short amount of time. I was not looking at the clock. I imagine this isn’t a surprise to anyone. Timing in cooking is vague and conditional, something sensed out and learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite knowing this about myself, it is sometimes easy for me to get take the numbers of minutes in someone else’s recipe as absolute. There are far too many variables that make this impossible. Even if the recipes were written from precise timings in the author’s kitchen, these do not necessarily or even often translate well into another kitchen.  Ingredients differ, altitudes differ, pans differ, burners differ, etc. There is a complex if not always logical process of translation. Often what the recipe says marks the dish as done is more absolute than the cooking time. But those numbers are not useless. They might tell me that something is different. If the recipe says 45 minutes and the cake has been in for an hour and still doesn’t look done, then something is different, even though what exactly is the work of sketchy reasoning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either improvised or from a recipe, cooking involves for me a great deal of anxiety about how long to cook something. The worst are the things I can’t taste for doneness, like baked goods or roast chicken. Or tea, which I rigidly time but am always wondering if I should leave the leaves in longer or take them out early. Even when I cook something as simple as sauteed vegetables I go to the pan every two minutes to taste how soft they are, and am constantly uncertain if they’re soft enough or too soft. It’s not really two minutes, it’s more like I’ll take it off the burner when I’m done reading a blog post, after I feed the dogs, after I go to the bathroom, after I finish doing the dishes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clock, in other words, is a deceptive ally to cooking. It deludes cooks into false certainties that assume the kitchen is the same as the mechanical innards of a clock. Timing, on the other hand, is essential.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/02/timing.html' title='Timing'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/1677444104283349046/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/02/timing.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1677444104283349046'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1677444104283349046'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/02/timing.html' title='Timing'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-3765195382807233457</id><published>2011-02-04T09:46:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:00:32.341-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Failed Psychogastronomy</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUw7DnTkxtI/AAAAAAAACxU/bROYV9yxJXg/s1600/IMG_0429.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUw7DnTkxtI/AAAAAAAACxU/bROYV9yxJXg/s320/IMG_0429.JPG" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It's easy for me to forget that food can have dire effects on us. More than something that is tasty, or something to eat because you are hungry, it heats you up, cools you down, energizes you, makes you sleepy, gives you a headache, burns your cheeks, as well as plenty else. There are also all the long-term health effects diet may have, but I am talking about effects at an immediate level of sensation, emotion, and bodily helplessness. Taking a cue from bringing to light the abject aspect of digestion, I want to conceptually explode the body and the subject further. Rather than thinking of food as having effects upon the self or the body, but I would like to think of food's entry itself as a beginning of these identities. Let us take the adage "you are what you eat" to an extreme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can language do this? Can subject, object, and verb be arranged to bring about their undoing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bring this up because of a fairly mundane drink of yogurt, water, and honey. It was just what I needed at the time I drank it; it was soothing and cooling (both in the sense of temperature and otherwise). For a while it transformed what I could and could not sense. It would be nice to place cognition aside from this externalizing gustatory scene, but I'm afraid it too bends and is bent by eating. I began to write the recipe for this drink, which led somehow into reading lassi recipes online. My half-cognition&amp;nbsp;of what happened recognized itself through a descriptor in one of these recipes: "soothing." This validated my feeling that the drink had brought about a change. Which brings me to trying to write this and having difficulty remembering anything beyond the words I read in that recipe somewhere (and I can’t find the recipe either). This doesn’t make the case for what I was saying about cognition at all. Damn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;Honey Lassi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup yogurt&lt;br /&gt;1 cup water&lt;br /&gt;2 teaspoons honey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a glass drip honey over yogurt. Use honey-covered spoon to mix together yogurt and honey as thoroughly as possible. Without removing spoon, add water. Stir until most of the honey is dissolved from the spoon.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/02/failed-psychogastronomy.html' title='Failed Psychogastronomy'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/3765195382807233457/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/02/failed-psychogastronomy.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3765195382807233457'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3765195382807233457'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/02/failed-psychogastronomy.html' title='Failed Psychogastronomy'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUw7DnTkxtI/AAAAAAAACxU/bROYV9yxJXg/s72-c/IMG_0429.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-2868838029458891355</id><published>2011-02-01T00:22:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:00:32.331-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Pantry Cleanse I: Assorted Legumes</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUevp9OjlVI/AAAAAAAACw4/VM4cRbTzD8I/s1600/IMG_0419.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUevp9OjlVI/AAAAAAAACw4/VM4cRbTzD8I/s200/IMG_0419.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Whoever decided to package several different varieties of beans and lentils in a “Gourmet Bean Blend” is an idiot. A very clever idiot, because people buy this stuff. It’s an appealing idea to make soup from this rainbow legume hodgepodge, however the logistics of actually cooking them all together like this are impossible, or at the very least not ideal. The trouble is that a yellow split pea and and a red bean take vastly different amounts of time to cook, and uncooked legumes do not taste good. The only solution is to cook the largest beans completely, and in so doing cook everything else to death. As we often hear, the lowest common denominator tyrannizes everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUevpRClGfI/AAAAAAAACw0/zir9Eo6GTvc/s1600/IMG_0418.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUevpRClGfI/AAAAAAAACw0/zir9Eo6GTvc/s200/IMG_0418.JPG" width="150" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Beans take a long time to cook. This wouldn’t much of an issue, except that      legumes are to soup what dirt is to mud--they settle to the bottom. So they have to be unstuck from the bottom every few minutes to keep them from burning. After five hours of walking back and forth between the pot of beans and whatever else I was doing, it was two in the morning and I was sick of it. The beans were not entirely cooked, but they were edible. Sometimes, as in writing this blog entry, one has to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;2 cups "Gourmet Bean Blend"&lt;br /&gt;6 medium tomatoes&lt;br /&gt;1 large onion&lt;br /&gt;3 tablespoons cooking oil&lt;br /&gt;2 cloves garlic&lt;br /&gt;2 teaspoons mustard seeds&lt;br /&gt;1 tablespoon coriander powder&lt;br /&gt;1 1/2 tablespoons sambar powder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUevq3el8gI/AAAAAAAACxA/rhZXVJEUu4U/s1600/IMG_0426.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUevq3el8gI/AAAAAAAACxA/rhZXVJEUu4U/s200/IMG_0426.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Soak beans in cold water for 8 hours. Finely chop onion and garlic. Drain water that beans were soaking in, and transfer beans to a large pot. Cover beans in 2 inches of water and begin bringing it to a boil. In a large, covered saucepan on medium heat fry mustard seeds in oil until most of them pop. Add onion and garlic and reduce heat to medium-low. Add coriander and sambar powder. Continue frying until onions are soft, stirring every few minutes. When beans have begun to boil, reduce heat to medium-low. Cut tomatoes into large chunks. When onions are done mix in tomatoes. When tomatoes have disintegrated and reduced to a thick sauce, transfer tomato-onion mixture to bean pot. Cook for however long it takes for all beans to become tender, possibly six hours. Stir often to keep from burning. When done, salt to taste.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/02/pantry-cleanse-i-assorted-legumes.html' title='Pantry Cleanse I: Assorted Legumes'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/2868838029458891355/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/02/pantry-cleanse-i-assorted-legumes.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2868838029458891355'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/2868838029458891355'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/02/pantry-cleanse-i-assorted-legumes.html' title='Pantry Cleanse I: Assorted Legumes'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUevp9OjlVI/AAAAAAAACw4/VM4cRbTzD8I/s72-c/IMG_0419.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-6229211688705318998</id><published>2011-01-31T03:36:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:00:32.385-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Roasted Kale &amp; Parsnips</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUaeA-UoxsI/AAAAAAAACwk/TuIdxVmx0ho/s1600/IMG_0417.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUaeA-UoxsI/AAAAAAAACwk/TuIdxVmx0ho/s320/IMG_0417.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;1 bunch kale (entire kale plant)&lt;br /&gt;3 medium parsnips&lt;br /&gt;1 lime&lt;br /&gt;1 tablespoons olive oil&lt;br /&gt;1 teaspoon coriander&lt;br /&gt;1/2 teaspoon black pepper&lt;br /&gt;1/2 teaspoon salt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preheat oven to 425 F.

First cut them into three sections which are each as close to uniform in diameter their entire lengths. Cut the largest in half. Cut all the sections into 1/4 inch wide chunks, perpendicular to the radial axis. Coat small roasting pan with olive oil. Lay kale in pan. Lay parsnips on top of kale.

Not tomato red or beet red, it's more fake blood&amp;nbsp;red. The color seems &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;to me; bacony tomato sauce should not hurt the eyes to look at. To me it's a color that on the whole doesn't fall into the category of edible. Eating it is a very disjunctive experience: what I taste is not what I see. This is probably because I have learned throughout life to anticipate taste from appearance, along with a number of other cues. Foods "look tasty." This sauce, rather than looking tasty, or even looking like sauce, looks like raw meat, blood, candy, or some kind of overzealous berry. Looking at the food while eating it, rather than creating a suturing movement like this paragraph, creates more confusion than the following metaphor: the sewing machine sticks and the needle breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might even say, in one of the more postmodern gustatory aesthetics, that good food causes such renewing sensory rupture. Of course, ideally it does so more subtly than by blaring a neon red siren in your face and then handing you a plate of tomato sauce.&amp;nbsp;Comfort food, on the other hand, strives toward a mimetic reproduction of your preconceptions. There can never really be, but comfort food may accomodate. What we have in this opposition of comfort and "good" is an&amp;nbsp;appallingly&amp;nbsp;bad account of what makes food good. Food full of the unexpected and disjunctive may still be bad, mediocre, nauseating, or even inedible. And comfort food also may be all of these things. This is not a way of evaluating the goodness of food, but a way of defining differing aesthetic modes. "Good" and "comfort" might be better termed "high" and "low."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What brought me here? Beets. The color of one of the oldest vegetables jars me into having to convince myself that tomatoes and bacon in fact taste like tomatoes and bacon. It has such an effect, I think, because it reminds me of blood--fake blood, and therefore of the permeability of bodily boundaries. We have become used to putting substances in our mouths and swallowing them. In fact, depending on the account of childhood psychological development you subscribe to, there may never have been a time when we were not used to it. Nonetheless we generally have come to think of the process of eating as not at all at odds with being contained within our bodies. Voiding waste is only slightly more threatening to this sealed bodily conception. But as much as straight male psychology&amp;nbsp;at some unconscious level&amp;nbsp;depends on rejecting it entirely, there is no avoiding it: things enter us and exit us through multiple orifices, including us. And blood, although generally this only exits. But from the plate in front of me deep red sauce enters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUMWbP7QLkI/AAAAAAAACv8/WYZNBLfOW0U/s1600/IMG_0396.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUMWbP7QLkI/AAAAAAAACv8/WYZNBLfOW0U/s200/IMG_0396.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;1/2 large onion&lt;br /&gt;1 small red beet&lt;br /&gt;2 cloves garlic&lt;br /&gt;7 medium frozen tomatoes&lt;br /&gt;3 strips bacon&lt;br /&gt;handful or two baby spinach&lt;br /&gt;juice of 1/4 lemon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;3 teaspoons dried basil&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;1 teaspoon dried oregano&lt;/div&gt;1/4 teaspoon black pepper&lt;br /&gt;salt to taste (1/2 teaspoon?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUMXyt4BTJI/AAAAAAAACwE/9zOm9tc-wgA/s1600/IMG_0405.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUMXyt4BTJI/AAAAAAAACwE/9zOm9tc-wgA/s200/IMG_0405.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Fill a large saucepan 1/2in up the rim with water, add frozen tomatoes, and put on medium-high heat. In another large saucepan begin frying bacon on medium heat. Peel and finely chop onion, beet, and garlic. When bacon is browned on both sides (but not crispy), remove onto a cutting board or plate. Scrape blackened bits from bottom of pan with spatula. Reduce heat to medium-low and add onion, beet, garlic, black pepper, and a pinch of salt. Tomatoes should be about thawed at this point. Remove from heat, drain water, remove skins, and chop tomatoes into large chunks. Put tomatoes back on medium-low heat to begin reducing. Stir frying onion mixture every few minutes. When onions are very soft (maybe 25 minutes), transfer tomatoes to frying saucepan and add basil, oregano, and lemon juice. Stir. Continue reducing sauce. When it's the right consistency, add baby spinach. Allow it to wilt for a few minutes and then stir it into the sauce. Salt to taste. Serve over pasta or quinoa.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/01/quinoa-with-tomato-bacon-beet-spinach.html' title='Quinoa with Tomato-Bacon-Beet-Spinach Sauce'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/9205548120476302650/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/01/quinoa-with-tomato-bacon-beet-spinach.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/9205548120476302650'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/9205548120476302650'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/01/quinoa-with-tomato-bacon-beet-spinach.html' title='Quinoa with Tomato-Bacon-Beet-Spinach Sauce'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUMXahu7cII/AAAAAAAACwA/ReKfwYK-W0Y/s72-c/IMG_0408.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-5026464063536758588</id><published>2011-01-27T14:01:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:00:32.363-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Biscuits &amp; Kidney Beans</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUHkKRbWqNI/AAAAAAAACvo/NyQgkue3NL0/s1600/IMG_0390.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUHkKRbWqNI/AAAAAAAACvo/NyQgkue3NL0/s200/IMG_0390.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Yesterday, in an attempt to entertain myself by imposing arbitrary lifestyle contraints, I decided not to use my computer. Yes, it's true, I composed this with pen and paper. Laugh it up at my affectation. The point is that instead of looking to the internet for proportions of flour, butter, and milk, I followed The Joy of Cooking (1972 edition) recipe for biscuits. It calls for kneading the dough "a scant 1/2 minute." (I do love this book's diction. It has so many instructions it creates its own semantic universe in which every term has precise meaning.) I had never realized kneading might be an important part of making biscuits; I thought one was supposed to handle the dough as little as possible. It turns out kneading is how they're made flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUHkF-oKJhI/AAAAAAAACvc/iNXdkGoY4HQ/s1600/joy_of_cooking-rolled_biscuits.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUHkF-oKJhI/AAAAAAAACvc/iNXdkGoY4HQ/s640/joy_of_cooking-rolled_biscuits.png" width="377" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUHkHU4eTRI/AAAAAAAACvg/fIG-XwdvMBY/s1600/IMG_0393.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUHkHU4eTRI/AAAAAAAACvg/fIG-XwdvMBY/s200/IMG_0393.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I may have rolled the dough too thin. The recipe says to roll "until the dough has the desired thickness." That was a quarter of an inch in my case. They only rose to about half an inch. My brother commented that they looked English. They do look more like I imagine scones should look than they do biscuits. But they're too thin to be cut in half. So they aren't even scones really. But I like them. There's something really nice about the way they get stale. They get stiff and just a bit chewy. In this stale state they're perfectly suited to eating with hot liquids such as tea or soup. And they're the sort of thing &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2011/01/corn-dodgers-lembas.html"&gt;you would put in your&amp;nbsp;knapsack&amp;nbsp;before setting off into the forest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUHj-SsFj0I/AAAAAAAACvY/NQ-dbo7Qdio/s1600/IMG_0395.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUHj-SsFj0I/AAAAAAAACvY/NQ-dbo7Qdio/s400/IMG_0395.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made these to go with a pot of kidney beans seasoned with sambar powder. This came about because I couldn't find the cayenne chili powder I wanted to use. (The sambar powder consists mostly of chilis.) I'm not sure it's the greatest combination, but it was an improvement over kidney beans without the seasoning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUHkI72_jPI/AAAAAAAACvk/d_2bQibIFkw/s1600/IMG_0391.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TUHkI72_jPI/AAAAAAAACvk/d_2bQibIFkw/s200/IMG_0391.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;2 cans cooked kidney beans&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup water&lt;br /&gt;2 tablespoons cooking oil&lt;br /&gt;1 large onion&lt;br /&gt;2 cloves garlic&lt;br /&gt;3 teaspoons sambar powder&lt;br /&gt;1 teaspoon dried oregano&lt;br /&gt;salt to taste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chop onion into medium pieces roughly 1/2in square.

Each entry is motivated by another entry that's never written. And there are still more unwritten entries which have simply been forgotten. And sometimes what I want to write is never even at play in a written entry. It just slips my mind, and I'm left to type out unbidden words only because I've cooked something and photographed it and ought to have something to say about it. Despite being obligated like this, there are still plenty of photos of food I intended to write about but never did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the blog trundles forward entry by entry, it does so in an attempt to recapture what it has left behind, and,&amp;nbsp;fumbling, yet more slips out of its grasp. These movements do not necessarily result in&amp;nbsp;repetitive&amp;nbsp;content. I leave trains of thought like "recipeness" behind, wishing I could still write more about them but can't, don't. My nostalgia for them just pushes me to write about something else with similar zeal, even though my writing on any one topic is vague and unfinished.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/01/overused-metaphor.html' title='An Overused Metaphor'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/7415067467450425183/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/01/an-overused-metaphor.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7415067467450425183'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7415067467450425183'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/01/an-overused-metaphor.html' title='An Overused Metaphor'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8866823115097989876</id><published>2011-01-23T18:52:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:00:32.435-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Inedibles: Beet Cake and Boiled Turnip</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="p1"&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TTzn2pYF-wI/AAAAAAAACr8/pkd6wJtjvTA/s1600/IMG_0375.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TTzn2pYF-wI/AAAAAAAACr8/pkd6wJtjvTA/s200/IMG_0375.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;As &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dnj5QVzrq8"&gt;a certain song&lt;/a&gt; would put it: what is a cake with no one to eat it? I have complained, I have belittled, and I have relativized, but never* have I written on this blog about something I cooked and refused to eat.&amp;nbsp; How does one deal with inedible food, and just what is meant by ‘inedible’?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;I began composing this entry before I made the beet cake. Specifically I planned to write that I began composing the entry before I baked or ate the beet cake that the entry was to be about. I was supposed to then connect this fact to the idea that I tasted the cake before I tasted it--an idea I have been developing (or perhaps only reiterating) in recent entries. But instead the real cake completely collapsed the cake I had imagined (in addition to itself physically collapsing). It went against my expectations in the most extreme way. I couldn’t even manage to eat more than a bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XYLvvs8Ubi0/SbyU0pgAQrI/AAAAAAAABpY/KNHtuZKWK2I/s1600/Picture+174.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XYLvvs8Ubi0/SbyU0pgAQrI/AAAAAAAABpY/KNHtuZKWK2I/s200/Picture+174.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The photo from &lt;a href="http://when-mia-cooks.blogspot.com/"&gt;When Mia Cooks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;After the last time I wrote about beets I googled beet cake, and, really, just looked for the most appealing images. The photo of uncooked batter &lt;a href="http://when-mia-cooks.blogspot.com/2009/03/beet-cake.html"&gt;in one recipe&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;looked incredible: bright pink. Although the interior of the cake is hidden in all of the photos (all are taken from directly above the item), I suspect that it was in fact cake, and not whatever substance my ‘cake’ turned out to be.&amp;nbsp; Of course I didn’t exactly follow the recipe. My most egregious mistake, I think, was not measuring the amount of beets while following the measurements of everything else (eggs, flour, baking powder). But who knows. Now I want to write a recipe for something not at all appealing or expected, but photographs well. Watch out for that one. (Not that I imagine anyone is following any of the recipes I post.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TTzn1i0SOXI/AAAAAAAACr4/XFWdBlzajoU/s1600/IMG_0378.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TTzn1i0SOXI/AAAAAAAACr4/XFWdBlzajoU/s200/IMG_0378.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In preparation to be blogged, the process of creating the cake was photo-documented in detail. You can see the beets being boiled whole, releasing their wine-colored dye into the water. For some reason I decided that, contrary to the recipes I had read, I needed to boil the beets and puree them in a food processor rather than grate them into the cake batter. You can see the deep violet (even violent violet) batter, and the pink frosting. I reserved and then reduced the dyed water that the beets were boiled in, and used this liquid in the buttercream frosting. The reduced liquid had an overpowering taste, but the frosting was both delicious and pretty. You can see that the ‘cake’ that came out of the oven even looked like a cake on the outside, just like the photos from the recipe I didn’t follow. But look inside to see the strange, soggy result. It might be best described as beet puree with other things in it, as opposed to cake with beet puree in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TTznzkVXtqI/AAAAAAAACr0/DCXI0Nr80yY/s1600/IMG_0381.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TTznzkVXtqI/AAAAAAAACr0/DCXI0Nr80yY/s200/IMG_0381.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;What you can’t see is that I deliberately omitted sugar from the cake. I wanted to see how sweet a cake only sweetened with beets could be. Also I was motivated by the beet mythology that I established &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2011/01/inadvisable-meal-ii-beets-sausage.html"&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The beets, I thought, should not be corrupted by their inferior cousin, sugar. My plan was to keep the sugar separate, to load enough sugar into the frosting that the cake would be sweet enough yet the beets would still remain beets. In the end omitting sugar from the cake only made it more disgusting than its texture did already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;Earlier I wrote of beets as an antithesis to taste in relation. I treated beets as a taste singularity around which language strains to find adequate comparisons. What happens when a singularity is baked into a cake? It intervenes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;When I was carrying them home, the beets stained a library book I had in the same bag. One more beet just fell out of my bag. I had no idea it was still there, lurking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TTznyd3pKpI/AAAAAAAACrw/_lI4ZqlUkyk/s1600/IMG_0383.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TTznyd3pKpI/AAAAAAAACrw/_lI4ZqlUkyk/s200/IMG_0383.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It wasn’t just the beet cake that was inedible. Mashed turnip too. I assume this is the work of the beet. However I would also be willing to believe, given the legends surrounding mandrake root, that all roots are malevolently disposed. I had never tried turnips before. One reader pointed out that the turnip I boiled and mashed may not have been ripe. Do turnips &lt;i&gt;ripen&lt;/i&gt;? “Doesn’t everything ripen?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p3"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TTznw36WBgI/AAAAAAAACrs/VEa6JFTi9QU/s1600/IMG_0385.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TTznw36WBgI/AAAAAAAACrs/VEa6JFTi9QU/s200/IMG_0385.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I feel obligated to describe how the turnip was inedible. I’ll go about this in a roundabout way by describing the anxieties that &lt;a href="http://www.vegancoach.com/boiled-turnips.html"&gt;the guide to cooking turnips I found online&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;gave me. While not explicitly saying so, the guide gave the impression that the turnip is a toxic vegetable, similar to, say, cassava. It warned that “turnips tend to have a bitter flavor if not boiled long enough, with at least ONE water change (usually two)!!” I had to extract the bitterness from them by changing the water, &lt;i&gt;twice&lt;/i&gt;? Moreover for larger (and therefore more bitter) turnips “it is best to cook them uncovered so the bitter gasses can escape.” They have &lt;i&gt;gasses&lt;/i&gt;? What was I trying to do, exorcise a possessed vegetable? If so I was not successful. The cooked turnip smelled nice, but I could not stomach it. It was not an immediate bitterness; it twisted slowly in my mouth, making all food distasteful for the rest of the evening. It was something evil. But I’m willing to believe that the evil can be more completely beaten out the turnip, if not entirely, and that the result would be tasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p4"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p3"&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TTznvbwbAYI/AAAAAAAACro/ylATRLgAWUA/s1600/IMG_0389.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TTznvbwbAYI/AAAAAAAACro/ylATRLgAWUA/s200/IMG_0389.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I was going to write about the (im)possibility of taste independent of other tastes. This was brought about by the realization that my writing usually peters out into thematic dissonance. Themes may be dissonant, but can they have no relation to one another? Can tastes? Circumstances changed , but I could have just the same written about &lt;i&gt;bad&lt;/i&gt; taste (in)dependent of other bad tastes, or good tastes. I could have tried to answer the inane question: does the turnip I didn’t eat constitute a singularity of inedibility?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p4"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p3"&gt;It turns out this was not an entry concerned with the ontology of inedibles. Instead I wrote a great deal about how the inedibles were cooked, and how they tasted. Their specific visceralness blinds me to the social construction of inedibility waiting just beyond the immediate “ew.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;* Except on &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2009/10/ham-tea.html"&gt;one occasion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/01/inedibles-beet-cake-and-boiled-turnip.html' title='Inedibles: Beet Cake and Boiled Turnip'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/8866823115097989876/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/01/inedibles-beet-cake-and-boiled-turnip.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8866823115097989876'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8866823115097989876'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/01/inedibles-beet-cake-and-boiled-turnip.html' title='Inedibles: Beet Cake and Boiled Turnip'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TTzn2pYF-wI/AAAAAAAACr8/pkd6wJtjvTA/s72-c/IMG_0375.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-1468812480178998971</id><published>2011-01-21T14:36:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:00:32.312-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>To write this blog is to find new ways of describing how food is disgusting.</title><content type='html'>I hate cooking. Have I mentioned that? Also I want to do nothing but cook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the one hand, the need to eat is an obstacle to the rest of life. I don't want to have to eat. But I'm always eating to preempt hunger--not so much a a desire to eat as a visceral awareness that I need to eat. Hastily and begrudgingly I try to fill myself with adequate food so that I can get on with life. &lt;i&gt;Can’t I get this over with?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most mornings all I really want is tea. I want to have my time with tea, or I should say of tea: it is supposed to pull me out of time’s regular flow into tea time. Tea is in this way &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2011/01/pastrys-conspiracy.html"&gt;a kind of pastry&lt;/a&gt;. However tea is in reality never enjoyable by itself. One has to be enjoying something else--to be enveloped by, focused on, or occupied by something else for tea time to happen (or not happen) at all, if it does. Usually, lacking in some other enjoyment, tea time really is no time at all, in the wrong way. It passes quickly, bringing me almost immediately to tepid sloshings of acrid, camel liquid--then out of (in the sense of having run out) but very much in time and out of tea. So, dispassionataely, I cook breakfast out of necessity. This is how I hate cooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand I want the same impossible thing from cooking that I want from tea. I want to escape through cooking. I want the process to be involving enough that I forget everything else. I want a kind of productivity for which there is no need. The taste of the results, really, is not all that important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biscotti are dry, crumbly, tasteless things. Hunks of stuff to have with coffee. By themselves they are blah. Good coffee has a slight aroma of shit. This is an incomplete metaphor that doesn’t work; it doesn’t just leave a slight trace behind, it leaves whole swaths fallow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can’t not eat, and one can’t only cook--then one would be a cook, and would have to get one’s jollies elsewhere.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/01/to-write-this-blog-is-to-find-new-ways.html'

type='text'>This is a tea commercial and the slogan is "taste the secret."</title><content type='html'>Generally I poo-poo herbal tea. &amp;nbsp;When I do drink herbal teas, it is ginger or chamomile. &amp;nbsp;I think this is because I don't have for it one of those yet-unnamed "way in which food compels," which I'm tempted at the moment to call exoticization. &amp;nbsp;But I'll let the terminology simmer for now. &amp;nbsp;Instead I'll illustrate the appreciation I don't have for herbal tea with a scenario.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're in Starbucks. &amp;nbsp;There are too many things there, but to simplify the situation you could get coffee or you could get tea. &amp;nbsp;Coffee seems the safe option, as they are in the business of coffee, after all. &amp;nbsp;If you get tea it will probably come in a bag and be brought stewing in lukewarm water. &amp;nbsp;But you're not after fine or well-brewed tea. &amp;nbsp;You're not here to be picky and get what you expect. &amp;nbsp;You get some herbal infusion full of arcane-sounding fruits, herbs, and spices and named after some far-flung locale. &amp;nbsp;It's not that you care particularly what's in it or what it's called--these are all just allusions to what you want. &amp;nbsp;You put your nose to the steam swirling from the cup and feel like you're privvy to a secret. &amp;nbsp;The aroma taps you into the ephemera of some other life lost to nearly everyone else. &amp;nbsp;They're all drinking coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That whole scenario is a lie. &amp;nbsp;It's the addressed who leads "some other life lost to nearly everyone else," which, through an imagined appreciation of tea, I wish to access in the same manner.</content><link rel='related'

have an excess of color. &amp;nbsp;They stain everything around them bright red and still their color remains incorruptably deep. &amp;nbsp;They taste like they look. &amp;nbsp;They're too much. &amp;nbsp;It is as if cane sugar is a weak imitation, and red beet is the true flavor of sweet. &amp;nbsp;We learn from the beet that sweet is in fact not entirely pleasant; it turns the mouth in on itself and pounds the tongue with sticky rocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, beets should be tempered with other things. &amp;nbsp;Do not eat a pile of beets with beet sauce. &amp;nbsp;A pile of beets with sausage covered in beet sauce is not much of an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In elementary school I knew this Jehovah's Witness who loved beets. &amp;nbsp;In the cafeteria he would sit down with a huge helping of ruffle-cut beets on his tray, lustily spearing them with his fork and turning his bulging lips red by slurping them into his clumsy mouth. &amp;nbsp;"Oh, I love beets," he would say. &amp;nbsp;We would all grimace in disgust. &amp;nbsp;Some would try to make fun of him, but he would just laugh and flash back an evil, self-contented smile between chomps. &amp;nbsp;Somehow I always liked him. &amp;nbsp;No harm could touch him. &amp;nbsp;He had become a beet, staining everything and impossible to stain. &amp;nbsp;The dye of beets is the only true substance. &amp;nbsp;A beet may be eaten, but its color persists and travels through you, eventually ending up in the ocean. &amp;nbsp;How the oceans are not a deep magenta is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had planned to write this in the morning, but tonight beets have kept me up writing about beets. &amp;nbsp;The beet has disrupted my plans and it smirks. &amp;nbsp;Pastry may be sorcery, but the beet is something much older, purer,&amp;nbsp;and more insidious. &amp;nbsp;Root vegetables are coming into vogue like never before. &amp;nbsp;It is the age of roots, and the beet is rising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sick of beets. &amp;nbsp;Perhaps I should make a beet cake, or a beet pie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;&lt;a

Altgelt&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;apparently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I usually eat this quickly because I want it to go away. The salad without the fish would be appealing, but here it serves mostly to mask the flavor of the slimy, five-day-old fish. Seriously, in the fridge the cooked fish gained a layer of transparent slime at the bottom. Okay, fine, it's not that it tastes or smells particularly bad, but the idea of it makes me feel it will taste bad enough to make me vomit at any moment. Eating it is an exercise in repressing a nausea of potential. It only came about because of one of my dad's Costco misadventures, in which he bought far too much salad greens and rockfish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without further ado, here is a recipe for an undesirable salad that came about in peculiar circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;2-3 large handfulls salad greens&lt;br /&gt;~1/2 cup cooked rockfish&lt;br /&gt;8 kalamata olives&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tablespoon balsamic vinegar&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tablespoon olive oil&lt;br /&gt;1/2 teaspoon black pepper&lt;br /&gt;1/4 teaspoon salt&lt;br /&gt;1 teaspoon honey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a large bowl place salad greens. &amp;nbsp;Tear olives in half into salad. &amp;nbsp;Tear bite-sized pieces of rockfish into salad. &amp;nbsp;Drizzle balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and honey over salad. &amp;nbsp;Sprinkle salt and pepper over salad. &amp;nbsp;Write one more sentence that ends in "salad," just in case your readers missed that everything was going into the salad.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/01/rockfish-salad.html' title='Rockfish Salad'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6209352905754589781/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/01/rockfish-salad.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6209352905754589781'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6209352905754589781'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/01/rockfish-salad.html' title='Rockfish Salad'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-6143874640871401416</id><published>2011-01-15T15:33:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:01:17.460-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Corn Dodgers &amp; Lembas</title><content type='html'>"True Grit" (1969) has corn dodgers. &amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Lord of The Rings&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;has lembas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could pretend to subtly treat these foods with their very different functions in their respective narratives, but the truth is I'm wrapping them both, and all of their cousins that I'm too lazy to research, into a doughy mass of sloppy exemplarity called "traveller's food." &amp;nbsp;Traveller's food is at the heart of one of high fantasy's fantasies: the long journey on foot. &amp;nbsp;(Westerns share this, but by far more often on horse.) &amp;nbsp;An adventurer, Bilbo might reminisce, does not travel bogged down with food. &amp;nbsp;No, he pops out the door with a knapsack and a cloak and is on his way. &amp;nbsp;In his knapsack he has a few bits of traveller's food--some bread and cheese perhaps (or some corn dodgers). &amp;nbsp;Traveller's food is rations but romanticized--hard tack but less disgusting while just as imperishable. &amp;nbsp;Despite its portability it is highly sustaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traveller's food is one of the more extreme ways that food can compel that I have been trying to communicate. &amp;nbsp;Can one ever really make traveller's food? &amp;nbsp;No, but if you're me as a teenager, its impossibility can be easily forgotten. There was a time when I labored under the illusion that I could walk for days in the mountains with nothing but the biscuits I had baked before embarking. &amp;nbsp;The fact that I always came back before the next day was due to a personal failing and was not a reason for disillusionment. &amp;nbsp;Moreover it wasn't precisely that I went home; I simply stopped being the adventurer. &amp;nbsp;I paused the game.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;No, the conflicting logics of "it was a personal failing" and "I paused the game" are not problematic. &amp;nbsp;They exemplify the necessary discontinuity of living in two. &amp;nbsp;In this manner I adventured for weeks in the wooded mountains while only doing so for an hour every day or two. &amp;nbsp;On the one hand adventuring army of one, on the other, at home on my computer. &amp;nbsp;(Not a strange combination at all, actually.) &amp;nbsp;The biscuits, obviously, did what they were supposed to.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/01/corn-dodgers-lembas.html' title='Corn Dodgers &amp;amp; Lembas'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/6143874640871401416/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/01/corn-dodgers-lembas.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6143874640871401416'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6143874640871401416'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/01/corn-dodgers-lembas.html' title='Corn Dodgers &amp;amp; Lembas'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4816571373956018751</id><published>2011-01-12T22:25:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:01:17.455-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Pastry's Conspiracy</title><content type='html'>In &lt;i&gt;The Last Unicorn &lt;/i&gt;nothing is quite what it seems. Great monsters are puffed up from the aspirations of common animals with a bit of magical trickery, and a unicorn goes about unrecognized as anything more than a white mare. The book’s tangle of seeming and being is much like what one encounters when one tries to unravel tasting and eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Food may be elevated to the &lt;a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/sam_sifton/index.html"&gt;snobby heights&lt;/a&gt; of having a “palette” because at some level it is a bare necessity. As animals, to live is to eat. There’s no getting around that. But we may sculpt food and manipulate it into dreams that could otherwise not be dreamt. Eggs may, for instance, be separated and whipped into sugary clouds. This is pastry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole object of pastry, it seems to me, is to create something unreal. With pastry we may believe briefly that &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPCzjHPS--U"&gt;hunger and nourishment do not exist&lt;/a&gt;, and that &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0048611/"&gt;beauty and taste are everything&lt;/a&gt;. Defined this way pastry comes to include not all desserts, but things such as ice cream, candy, and, liminally, some forms of haute cuisine,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.annathered.com/"&gt;decorative bento boxes&lt;/a&gt;, and even molded gelatine.&amp;nbsp;It is a strain of magic in cookery. In a purely imagined history it began as delights for jaded court royalty and eventually expanding to industrially produced Hostess cakes. &amp;nbsp;The empire of pastry has wriggled its way into the fabric of many lives and has necessitated enormous quantities of sugar plantations. Unlike the Illuminati, there is no one to cackle at bringing abstractions into the world. There is no pastry sorcerer* triumphantly grinning and wringing his hands. Pastry is its own sorcerer, its own cabal and its own cult leader, and it has no more control over its destiny than those that do its bidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meringue is a meagre beast, yet as beautiful and powerful as it is full of air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Although there are &lt;a href="http://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Pastamancer"&gt;pastamancers&lt;/a&gt;

recipe&lt;/a&gt; I've developed an instant righteousness about Bakewell Tart. &amp;nbsp;Nobody has ever heard of it around here. &amp;nbsp;The injustice! &amp;nbsp;I keep having to explain what it is. &amp;nbsp;My explanations being what they are (stunted, reluctant, and full of 'err's), I settled upon this one: it's basically butter, almonds, and sugar in a pie crust with a bit of raspberry jam. &amp;nbsp;This seems to simultaneously please and put people on edge. &amp;nbsp;Unless of course they have an faddish, ironic adoration of fat, in which case they pronounce the absurdly rich tart "awesome." &amp;nbsp;Why did I sweeten to this tart so quickly? &amp;nbsp;Because it's British, of course. &amp;nbsp;And how! &amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;infinitesimal&amp;nbsp;amount of fruit present is in the form of jam and buried beneath a vast stratum of stiff, buttery whiteness.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My version is flecked with brown because I couldn't find the recommended blanched almonds. &amp;nbsp;Instead I just put some raw almonds in the food processor. &amp;nbsp;I have to say if you consider the crust a given, this is one the easiest tarts ever. &amp;nbsp;Mix ground almonds, butter, sugar, and eggs together. &amp;nbsp;Spread the crust with raspberry jam. &amp;nbsp;Spread the almond mixture evenly on top of that, and bake it well. &amp;nbsp;I'm waiting for the rotten fruit to hit me for that one.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;&lt;div&gt;Adapted from &lt;a href="http://video.about.com/britishfood/Bakewell-Tart.htm"&gt;Elaine Lemm&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2010/03/bakewell-tart/"&gt;Smitten Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1 baked tart shell or pie crust&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1 1/2 sticks butter&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3/4 cup white sugar&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2 large eggs and one yolk&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1/2 cups almonds&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;zest of one lemon&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1/2 teaspoon almond extract&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2 tablespoons raspberry jam&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Preheat oven to 350 F. &amp;nbsp;Warm butter until soft but not liquid. &amp;nbsp;In a large mixing bowl cream butter and sugar together. &amp;nbsp;Whisk in eggs, yolk, lemon zest, and almond extract. &amp;nbsp;In a food processor grind almonds thoroughly but not into a paste (i.e. don't turn it into almond butter). &amp;nbsp;Mix ground almonds into the butter/egg/sugar mixture. &amp;nbsp;Spread raspberry jam on the bottom of the tart shell or pie crust. &amp;nbsp;Spread filling evenly on top of raspberry jam. &amp;nbsp;Bake for 50 minutes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2011/01/bakewell-tart.html' title='Bakewell Tart'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/4151372791149039629/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/01/bakewell-tart.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4151372791149039629'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/4151372791149039629'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/01/bakewell-tart.html' title='Bakewell Tart'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TSYzZzuxUQI/AAAAAAAACpo/rnQE7ckFCyE/s72-c/IMG_0349.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-103983993827737091</id><published>2011-01-03T16:05:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:00:32.309-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Ginger Tea</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

“It’s the pudden,” he confides, “I know what the pudden’s to be--apricot roll-up--oh my buttons!”&amp;nbsp; I’ve never heard of a roll-up before except of course those strips of candied fruit puree that kids used to (do they still?) have in paper-bag lunches called “fruit roll-ups.”&amp;nbsp; I assume this is a pastry.&amp;nbsp; It sounds very appealing, but more appealing to a not especially wealthy nineteenth-century English family who only ever has such things on special occasions than to my contemporary palate.&amp;nbsp; Apricot roll-up, ever since I read that sentence, has taken on a vibrant and uncertain life in my imagination.&amp;nbsp; I keep thinking of the words nd of why Tom is oh-my-buttonsing about it.&amp;nbsp; Incommensurate images float unresolved in my mind.&amp;nbsp; How is it rolled up?&amp;nbsp; It is made from fresh, dried, or otherwise preserved apricots?&amp;nbsp; What kind of pastry dough are they rolled up in: pate brisee, pate sablee, puff pastry, yeasted dough, or something else?&amp;nbsp; What is apricot roll-up?&amp;nbsp; At this point a google search would not answer the question I’m trying to ask.&amp;nbsp; I don’t want to know what it was historically, what George Eliot may have been referring to.&amp;nbsp; Because I don’t know what it is I have begun to imagine something.&amp;nbsp; I want to know what that something is, and in what ways it might be brought into the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

After making pear-ginger tarte tatin and sweet potato pie for Christmas, I still had some pie dough leftover in the fridge.&amp;nbsp; Thinking of apricot roll-up, I rolled the remaining dough into a roughly rectangular sheet, covered it in thin pear slices, sprinkled it with brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg, rolled it up and baked it at 400 F.&amp;nbsp; Well, fifteen minutes in I became paranoid that it wouldn’t become properly crisp and turned it up to 425 F.&amp;nbsp; Also I tried to pucker the ends together to keep the juices from running out too much.&amp;nbsp; The juices did run out and burned to a black caramel at the bottom of the pan, but I liked it.&amp;nbsp; It was a roll-up.&amp;nbsp; The nice thing about a culinary fantasy defined by a single word with little semantic grounding is that it can be many things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Some vagueness or polyvalence in what I imagine I’m making seems to be a necessary part of this equation.&amp;nbsp; Taste is again mediated by fantasy, but instead of the enticing photos I referred to as enthralling (as in actually placing me in their thrall) motivators to make &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2010/12/mrs-hudsons-biscuits-ii-hiding-behind.html"&gt;Mrs. Hudson’s Biscuits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2010/10/tarte-tatin-iii-golden-delicious-boring.html"&gt;tarte tatin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2010/12/something-you-really-shouldnt-make-and.html"&gt;apple strudel&lt;/a&gt;, this came of a written phrase.&amp;nbsp;

Going by the polite compliments of those who consumed the pear-ginger tarte tatin I made for Christmas dinner, my quibbles are excessive. Soggy crust does not matter. The way the butter rose to the top to form an off-white opacity does not matter. Hell, those things didn’t matter to me, either. I only wanted there to be more of it. Yet a sense of culinary aesthetics demands that the pears should not be laying in a pool of liquid when the tart is turned out onto a dish. (Maybe this could be avoided by using sugar instead of honey.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a sense that the making makes the dish, a conflation of the process with the result. The logic goes if I’m pleased with the pears boiling in honey--if it looks good, if it smells good--then the tart is good. This also goes for the sweet potato pie I made the same day. I liked its color (a bilious drab green), and what went into it. The light spices, the light sweetening of honey, the light color of the Japanese yam flesh, the thickness of the pie all came together in an aestheticism that had nothing to do with taste and yet constitutes a great part of taste. When I tasted it, it was the beauty of the process I was wishing for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why it is necessary but impossible to separate taste from aesthetics, pleasure from ideas. Necessary because taste does not come of itself, and impossible for the same reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might account for my former enthusiasm for the dozens of dense, eggy spice cakes by remembering my enjoyment of &lt;i&gt;what went into them&lt;/i&gt;. There was a subtle balancing art of ingredients and spices that went into these cakes that was impossible to discern in the finished product unless you were me. It was possible for me to taste some hidden nobility in the cake despite the consistency which I could somehow deny. More likely I only now, several years later, remember them as dense and disgusting, and at the time there were not other possibilities that I knew of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In honor of the cooking process’s interiority (if not the cook’s) rather than its ultimate appearance as taste to the world, the accompanying photos are of pear peels, pears boiling in honey, and unbaked sweet potato pie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excuse me. &amp;nbsp;Instead of "in honor of," the paragraph above should begin "to exploit," much like speeches that "honor" the dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times; font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TRjyPApI31I/AAAAAAAACo0/eJhIfYCXoUw/s1600/IMG_0300.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TRjyPApI31I/AAAAAAAACo0/eJhIfYCXoUw/s400/IMG_0300.JPG" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TRjyQrOZvwI/AAAAAAAACo4/t6OdL8VfV00/s1600/IMG_0305.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TRjyQrOZvwI/AAAAAAAACo4/t6OdL8VfV00/s400/IMG_0305.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TRjyQrOZvwI/AAAAAAAACo4/t6OdL8VfV00/s1600/IMG_0305.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TRjyN28RCjI/AAAAAAAACow/0CfSurcIa8w/s1600/IMG_0314.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TRjyN28RCjI/AAAAAAAACow/0CfSurcIa8w/s400/IMG_0314.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2010/12/taste.html' title='Taste'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/8413465179808461570/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2010/12/taste.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8413465179808461570'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8413465179808461570'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2010/12/taste.html' title='Taste'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TRjyPApI31I/AAAAAAAACo0/eJhIfYCXoUw/s72-c/IMG_0300.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8905089407911682664</id><published>2010-12-21T19:34:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:00:32.440-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>A General Guide to Braising Vegetables</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TRFwru4IR3I/AAAAAAAACok/zZpCEJ7FMuQ/s1600/IMG_0292.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TRFwru4IR3I/AAAAAAAACok/zZpCEJ7FMuQ/s200/IMG_0292.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Or maybe this is called stir-frying.

Heat a large saucepan to medium heat, add oil and spices. Temper spices for about thirty seconds before throwing in vegetables (carefully--they will sputter). Stir quickly to spread the spices around and stop them from burning. Fry on medium-high heat for about five minutes, stirring every minute. Add salt and flavorful liquids and cover for about three minutes. Continue steaming if not done (somewhere between crisp and mushy is my preference).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, every vegetable is different. Bok choy for instance doesn’t need as much cooking time, and only the stems need to be really cooked, whereas the leaves just need to be wilted. This recipe is based on carrots and parsnips which I fried with garlic and black pepper and steamed in lemon juice and mirin.  The parsnips cooked more quickly than carrots, and came out mushier than the carrots. Which was actually kind of nice.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2010/12/general-guide-to-braising-vegetables.html' title='A General Guide to Braising Vegetables'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/8905089407911682664/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2010/12/a-general-guide-to-braising-vegetables.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8905089407911682664'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8905089407911682664'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2010/12/a-general-guide-to-braising-vegetables.html' title='A General Guide to Braising Vegetables'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TRFwru4IR3I/AAAAAAAACok/zZpCEJ7FMuQ/s72-c/IMG_0292.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-450600653082841699</id><published>2010-12-19T09:54:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:00:32.354-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Mrs. Hudson's Biscuits II: Hiding Behind Photography</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TQ4_zOciT-I/AAAAAAAACoU/hd3WZWO7hSo/s1600/IMG_0287.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TQ4_zOciT-I/AAAAAAAACoU/hd3WZWO7hSo/s320/IMG_0287.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2010/11/mrs-hudsons-biscuits.html"&gt;This recipe&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is vastly improved using the right ingredient, corn flour, rather than the course corn meal that made the first time like eating sand. &amp;nbsp;The photo of the finished product I daresay is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TQ4_0o9Jk5I/AAAAAAAACoY/2DLLD1A4UCg/s1600/IMG_0274.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TQ4_0o9Jk5I/AAAAAAAACoY/2DLLD1A4UCg/s200/IMG_0274.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;There has got to be a better way to&lt;br /&gt;spread this into a circle.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I'm not sure, however, if they're "good." &amp;nbsp;It may look like a moist, dense cake, but the corn flour ensures a flat texture that dissolves into a paste of silt in the mouth. &amp;nbsp;It doesn't really taste baked--it's more like a grain paste molded into a pleasing shape, like a corn halvah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I spread the dough in a round pie pan, baking it as a sort of giant cookie, and then slicing into eighths once it was glazed and cooled. &amp;nbsp;Which admittedly makes far larger biscuits than called for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It's only the texture I'm iffy about--the flavors of lemon and corn go well together I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I try &lt;a href="http://bitsnbites.wordpress.com/2007/12/09/mrs-hudsons-biscuits-retro-challenge-10-and-novel-food-challenge-2/"&gt;this in the first place&lt;/a&gt;?

If it exceeded my expectations, you might wonder why then did I cook it? There is a bag full of dill seed, at least I think that’s what it is, in the kitchen cupboard, I have no idea why. I don’t know what could I have been cooking for which I specifically needed dill seed. It smelled appealing when I was looking for a way to cook some wilting kale. Not knowing what it was, and knowing that nobody else was going to eat it, I fried it and some black pepper in sesame oil before throwing in the kale, which in parts soon became almost blackened with slightly bitter anise-like flavor. I felt that this was becoming a disaster: burnt, nasty flavor. When I finally tasted it, I liked it, but doubted the verity of my impression. Is this simply novelty? Would anyone else like this? Would I like this at any other time? Could I have carried out any experiment and been happy with the results? In other words, does this taste exist only in the fleeting moments when I devoured the fried kale? This of course is also a delusion--the “taste” was built as I remembered it, thought of how I would describe it, and began writing this blog entry. And what will probably drive me to make it again is a desire to have again the inflated memory that never quite was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such food passions vary in their capacities to disgust, satisfy, and beg to be tried again. Take the sugar binges that made up a good deal of my friendship with someone: every so often (perhaps weeks, perhaps months or years) we would make an absurd amount of some sugary dessert. Our enthusiasm diminished dramatically the more of it we ate, and after not too long we became disgusted with it. I would usually continue to nibble, helplessly in its thrall, exemplifying and sometimes uttering the phrase “take it away from me.” Overdoing it like this cured us for quite a while of our desire for whatever we had just made. But eventually one of us would want to try this all over again--not necessarily the exact same dessert, but to again go through the process from desire to disgust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TQggGJsOhjI/AAAAAAAACoQ/HjZVu6EoxCo/s1600/screen-shot-2010-09-03-at-10-48-48-pm1.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="113" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TQggGJsOhjI/AAAAAAAACoQ/HjZVu6EoxCo/s200/screen-shot-2010-09-03-at-10-48-48-pm1.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226236/"&gt;Emma Recchi&lt;/a&gt;'s brief moment.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Favorite dishes are quieter and less dramatic. In fact, good cooking might be defined by its ability to not quite satisfy. To keep one on the point of wanting, to not overdo it. It is in this way that less can be more--one eats more to taste again what began but did not meet one’s fantasy. The impossible way to maintain a compelling fantasy is never-ending dynamism. The fantasy must never be revealed as already reached or completely out of reach. One must be kept always somewhat disappointed and somewhat hopeful. Among all the illimitable distractions of being, one sometimes strives to be entrapped briefly in such simplicity. Perhaps what I liked about the kale was its mixture of pain and pleasure, bitter and sweet. And maybe by singing such praises you will be convinced of what I am not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TQgfmJJMAuI/AAAAAAAACoM/T5RdZJMZ-s0/s1600/IMG_0263.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TQgfmJJMAuI/AAAAAAAACoM/T5RdZJMZ-s0/s320/IMG_0263.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TQgfknatvzI/AAAAAAAACoI/K7Z0wPE2HaQ/s1600/IMG_0264.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TQgfknatvzI/AAAAAAAACoI/K7Z0wPE2HaQ/s320/IMG_0264.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TQgfjQRGkDI/AAAAAAAACoE/0H8Yao7LdgU/s1600/IMG_0265.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TQgfjQRGkDI/AAAAAAAACoE/0H8Yao7LdgU/s320/IMG_0265.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TQgfhplAJII/AAAAAAAACoA/Xz85XZfZyD4/s1600/IMG_0266.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TQgfhplAJII/AAAAAAAACoA/Xz85XZfZyD4/s320/IMG_0266.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TQgfgZY0XVI/AAAAAAAACn8/Ry349V7dfn8/s1600/IMG_0270.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TQgfgZY0XVI/AAAAAAAACn8/Ry349V7dfn8/s320/IMG_0270.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;1 bunch Italian kale&lt;br /&gt;2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil&lt;br /&gt;1 teaspoon whole dill seeds&lt;br /&gt;1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper&lt;br /&gt;1/2 teaspoon salt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chop the bunch of kale every one inch, keeping the stemmy pieces separate from the leafy pieces.

It’s not just that there’s a lot of waiting, but also that there are so many stages of the process. This accounts, I think, for my enthusiasm for making soup. There are days of anticipation. First I have to salt the chicken, leaving the chicken to soak up the salt overnight. The next day I roast it, and if I’m feeling particularly impatient and productive, I begin simmering the stock in the same day. More likely it won’t be until the carcass is mostly picked off a day or two after I roast it that the stock is begun. Once the stock has finished simmering (usually I leave it overnight), finally soup can begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above is a simplification of what’s involved of course. Before roasting the chicken really should be dried out a bit in the interest of crispy skin, although honestly I don’t often bother. Before making stock the carcass should be stripped of most of the good meat (but not all), which is at once satisfying and daunting (despite the fact that it takes less than ten minutes). After the carcass has simmered with flavoring vegetables, the stock must be strained and possibly skimmed.

At least I began with some sort of guide: &lt;i&gt;Beyond Salmon&lt;/i&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://www.beyondsalmon.com/2009/06/roast-chicken-notes-legs.html"&gt;notes on roasting chicken legs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The potatoes, onions, and other vegetables (today it was broccolini) that I nest around the chicken collect and exude water, making the bottom of the chicken consistently soggy. &amp;nbsp;Because I don't have a meat thermometer I'm never quite sure when to take it out of the oven. &amp;nbsp;Testing for doneness involves cutting into it, which breaks the skin and exposes more flesh, so if it has to bake longer after testing it will lose moisture quickly. &amp;nbsp;Usually, paranoid, I err on the side of overdone, but this time by accident I undercooked it. &amp;nbsp;You can see in the photo that the leg meat looks fairly pink, as did the breast meat. &amp;nbsp;So I baked the meat sealed in in tinfoil at 300 F for another fifteen minutes or so. &amp;nbsp;Much of it is just going to go into the soup anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, about the vegetables. &amp;nbsp;The slices of onion and potato were sidled up to the chicken after the first ten minutes of baking (at 450 F). &amp;nbsp;When the chicken was done (or so I thought), the potatoes were not. &amp;nbsp;At this point I removed the chicken, added the broccolini to the roasting pan, mixed it in, and put it back in the oven for about another twenty minutes. &amp;nbsp;The vegetables have been soaking up flavor from the chicken, olive oil, lemon juice (along with the lemon halves in the pan), garlic, black pepper, and salt. &amp;nbsp;(If it were summer, there would also be thyme.) &amp;nbsp;I adore them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It occurs to me that the problem of soggy-bottom might be alleviated if I roasted the vegetables in another pan and poured the liquid from the chicken roasting pan into it when the chicken is done. &amp;nbsp;Alternatively I could make a gravy out of the chicken drippings and pour it over&amp;nbsp;separately&amp;nbsp;roasted vegetables. &amp;nbsp;But there is something appealing about this doomed method of roasting them together.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2010/12/chicken-attachments.html' title='Chicken Attachments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/5856465239335829728/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2010/12/chicken-attachments.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/5856465239335829728'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/5856465239335829728'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2010/12/chicken-attachments.html' title='Chicken Attachments'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TP2053uPaWI/AAAAAAAACnI/M48y4Rc4Fbw/s72-c/IMG_0236.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8547168331925410429</id><published>2010-12-05T12:36:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:01:17.467-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Photos &amp;

Looking for a way to use four granny smith apples, I was going to try to make "&lt;a href="http://allrecipes.com//Recipe/easy-apple-strudel/Detail.aspx"&gt;easy apple strudel&lt;/a&gt;," which more or less amounts to surrounding apple slices with puff pastry and baking it. &amp;nbsp;Unable to find puff pastry in the store, I bought phyllo dough instead, thinking that surely I could use this for something involving apples. &amp;nbsp;The &lt;a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Apple-Strudel/Detail.aspx"&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; I stumbled into on allrecipes was also a "strudel," and seemed to function upon a principle of turning phyllo into puff pastry by layering butter between each sheet. &amp;nbsp;That, it turned out, was a very optimistic reading of the author's thought process. &amp;nbsp;Granted, I didn't follow the recipe exactly. &amp;nbsp;The gist seemed to be: layer about eight sheets of phyllo with melted butter in a pan, then put some apples, sugar, and whatever else you want on top of it, and then... and then what? &amp;nbsp;Here the text of the recipe says one thing, while the photo clearly shows something quite different. &amp;nbsp;The recipe reads "roll the sheets up to form a log shape." &amp;nbsp;The photo looks more like the edges were rolled up to prevent juices from spilling out. &amp;nbsp;For reasons somewhat murky to me, I went for the photo. &amp;nbsp;It occurs to me now that anyone can submit a photo for a recipe on allrecipes. &amp;nbsp;Food photography incites a strong mimetic impulse, but here the assumption that the photos accompanying a recipe come from the author's execution of the recipe, filling out the vagaries that the recipe's words have left, is wrong. &amp;nbsp;In this case the photo is of someone else's (mis)execution of the recipe. &amp;nbsp;Allrecipes is thus where a recipe's signified is set adrift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The web 2.0 mechanism has wide limits, but of course there are plenty of other instances of dissonance between a recipe and its accompanying photography. &amp;nbsp;In those lavish coffee table cookbooks filled with beautiful photos that take up whole pages, the recipes often lack the finishing touches that made them look so good in the first place. &amp;nbsp;I have this Thai cookbook that mostly consists of photos of the countryside and its people living a far more aesthetic life than anyone possibly could. &amp;nbsp;In all the photos the dishes have these amazing garnishes, are placed on rustic tableware, and sometimes even contain ingredients that aren't in the recipe. &amp;nbsp;What draws me to make a particular recipe in the book is of course the photo, but not only is the recipe inadequate--it is impossible to recreate the photo unless you live in a fantasy version of Thailand. &amp;nbsp;In other words, rather than follow the recipe, you're better off going to a very upscale Thai restaurant in the US. &amp;nbsp;Yet if you do follow the recipe, it will be a medium through which to experience the photo. &amp;nbsp;Though you can see that your dish is not as it is pictured in the book, you taste the photo.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TPqmq0gud6I/AAAAAAAACnA/dswUnRazLUs/s1600/IMG_0227.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right;

It tasted about like it looked--okay. &amp;nbsp;The phyllo at the edges curled up and turned crunchy, which was mostly just annoying. &amp;nbsp;I ended up scraping most of the excess flakes off before putting a piece on a plate. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The bottom crust was far too tough, making it difficult to eat with a fork, as well as being an unpleasant texture. &amp;nbsp;The filling at least was nice: tangy, sweet, and cooked just right (the apples were neither mush nor crisp).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;As a result of the above&amp;nbsp;debacle, I now had a lot of browned phyllo flakes. &amp;nbsp;Rather than throw them away, I decided to turn them into a sort of bread pudding. &amp;nbsp;The pudding came out much better than the original "strudel" I think. &amp;nbsp;What follows is a very rough recipe, as I wasn't really measuring anything.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div

type='text'>Thanksgiving is not a Great Art</title><content type='html'>This being a cooking blog, some sort of Thanksgiving post is probably expected.  I was going to do one, actually, as I was planning on making &lt;a href="http://www.beyondsalmon.com/2010/11/happy-thanksgiving.html"&gt;pear-ginger tarte tatin&lt;/a&gt;.  But the pears weren't ripe yet, so I made sweet potato pies again.  The pies were good, but was there really anything to say about them?  The scope of this blog has mostly only included deliberate experiments (or trying new recipes), and sometimes brief recipes of particularly good improvisations.  But in fact "particularly good" is not at all the criterion for which improvised dishes or meals get written here and which don't.  There are no criteria really, I just post when I feel like it.  Some of the most well-remembered meals, usually those that were made to feed to my family, I never write down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How are these statements connected?&lt;br /&gt;"I'm very nervous when people talk about it as a great art."&lt;br /&gt;"There's a lot to be said for mindless repetitive activity."&lt;br /&gt;"It does not interest me if I'm not feeding people."&lt;br /&gt;Well, Nigella Lawson said all of them. In the same &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgLzkEog2nI"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; she said she was unfazed "when &lt;i&gt;How to Be a Domestic Goddess&lt;/i&gt; came out and I was railed against for being, you know, a traitor to the sisterhood, despite the fact that it was so obviously ironic." &amp;nbsp;Apparently Nigella expects we all share her level of self-consciousness in the nostalgia for domesticity she purveys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her story of how she started: when she was working as a journalist, she found space to think in the&amp;nbsp;repetitive&amp;nbsp;activities of cooking. &amp;nbsp;Making food, rather than a necessity, was in her story a psychological tool and a lifestyle choice. &amp;nbsp;Instead of feeding people because she's a housewife, she seems to self-consciously enjoy the fantasies that surrounded housewifery. &amp;nbsp;But obviously this is not the selfless fantasy of classic femininity. &amp;nbsp;One cooks for the pleasure of feeding, including the pleasure of feeding&amp;nbsp;oneself. &amp;nbsp;One returns from an&amp;nbsp;exhausting&amp;nbsp;night of partying &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQejeG2yUJQ"&gt;to make oneself bread pudding&lt;/a&gt; in the semidarkness of one's posh kitchen, and one eats it, alone, in bed. &amp;nbsp;If one is Nigella Lawson, one stages all this on camera and, I imagine, laughs about it. &amp;nbsp;What makes her so passionate about food, she is asked? &amp;nbsp;"I'm greedy."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blog, on the other hand, is more about curiosity than greed or giving. &amp;nbsp;Although in trying new techniques and recipes, I often take part in a bit of both these pleasures.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2010/11/thanksgiving-is-not-great-art.html' title='Thanksgiving is not a Great Art'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/1530010639796265978/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2010/11/thanksgiving-is-not-great-art.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1530010639796265978'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1530010639796265978'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2010/11/thanksgiving-is-not-great-art.html' title='Thanksgiving is not a Great Art'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-70379687077072065</id><published>2010-11-23T18:53:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:00:32.395-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Mrs. Hudson's Biscuits</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2264/2098877495_797275df8f.jpg?v=0" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2264/2098877495_797275df8f.jpg?v=0" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I was warned that the results of &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2010/11/principles-of-economy.html"&gt;the strange recipe&lt;/a&gt; given to me were equally strange. Two “strange”s in this limited vocabulary turns from “intriguing” to “bad.” So I tried making the much tastier-sounding (and looking) “&lt;a href="http://bitsnbites.wordpress.com/2007/12/09/mrs-hudsons-biscuits-retro-challenge-10-and-novel-food-challenge-2/"&gt;Mrs. Hudson’s Biscuits&lt;/a&gt;” instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="recipe"&gt;125 g. butter &lt;br /&gt;125 g icing sugar &lt;br /&gt;2 tsp vanilla sugar or 2 tsp sugar with 2-3 drops of vanilla extract &lt;br /&gt;1 egg &lt;br /&gt;1 pinch of salt &lt;br /&gt;juice and grated peel of 1/2 lemon &lt;br /&gt;125 g. flour &lt;br /&gt;125 g. cornflour&lt;br /&gt;1 knife tip baking powder &lt;br /&gt;butter to grease pan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glaze&lt;br /&gt;100 g. icing sugar&lt;br /&gt;2 tbsps lemon juice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whip the butter until it is fluffy, then slowly add the icing sugar;&lt;br /&gt;Add the vanilla sugar, egg, salt, lemon juice and peel;&lt;br /&gt;Add the flour, baking powder and cornflour slowly and mix well;&lt;br /&gt;Grease a baking tray with butter;&lt;br /&gt;Fill a pastry bag with the dough and press small biscuits onto the baking tray;&lt;br /&gt;Bake in a preheated 400F oven for 10-15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Make the glaze by mixing the icing sugar and lemon juice.

One, in my enthusiasm for not having to go to the store, I used course corn meal instead of corn flour. That there was a difference didn’t even occur to me until I crunched down on a bit of the dough. Two, I preheated the oven to 350 F instead of 400 F. The first batch was baked at 350 F for the first five minutes. There’s not quite a third--a mistake, but not an oops: I tried to make a pastry bag to create the neat little shapes pictured along with this recipe that sort of resemble breasts, but as you can see from the photo, it, well, broke. I used a spoon and my fingers instead. Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TOx8FkzAbtI/AAAAAAAACmY/VWdidNMKH4U/s1600/IMG_0210.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TOx8FkzAbtI/AAAAAAAACmY/VWdidNMKH4U/s200/IMG_0210.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Melted butter and icing sugar.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;And one other, that may not have mattered at all in the end: the recipe said to “whip the butter until it is fluffy.” Not quite knowing how to whip cold butter, I melted it. Mixing icing sugar into this makes for a somewhat disgusting-looking, greasy mess. But as long as the butter has chance to cool a bit before the dough is baked, I don’t think it makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They may not be the most perfect replicas, but they’re quite nice. The lemon flavor is pleasingly strong.

When these ingredients are mixed, add the eggs and lemon juice. Beat the mixture well for a few minutes, then drop from a spoon onto a buttered baking sheet, about 2 inches apart. Bake the biscuits from 15-20 minutes in a moderate (350F) oven, until they lightly brown.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who measures sugar by weight? &amp;nbsp;To me 6 oz seems like it isn't much at all. &amp;nbsp;The small amount of butter and sugar makes me want to classify these as a tea biscuit--something fairly bland but somewhat sweet. &amp;nbsp;But then there are the two eggs. &amp;nbsp;Two, for this little batch of dough? &amp;nbsp;They're bound to come out like dry, dense cakes (no rising agent here). &amp;nbsp;Who knows.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table

type='text'>Sweet Potato Pie</title><content type='html'>I made sweet potato pie. &amp;nbsp;I followed the recipe from &lt;a href="http://allrecipes.com//Recipe/sweet-potato-pie-i/Detail.aspx"&gt;the first google hit&lt;/a&gt; for "sweet potato pie," with some alterations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this worth writing about?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made some very broad statements in &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2010/11/disappointment.html"&gt;the last post&lt;/a&gt;, as I'm wont to do. &amp;nbsp;While I was making the crust for the pie, I kept having to look back at the recipe I adapted from &lt;a href="http://www.beyondsalmon.com/"&gt;Helen Rennie&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to remember quantities. &amp;nbsp;Despite making pastry dough many times, I&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;needed&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;that recipe. &amp;nbsp;Or at least I needed its list of quantities. &amp;nbsp;The recipe is not disposable. &amp;nbsp;It's a kind of helper--somewhere to defer my memory. &amp;nbsp;It's an instance of a cliche of how the internet has changed the nature of knowledge: it's not so important if one remembers everything, so long as one knows where to look. &amp;nbsp;In the case of recipes however, the internet is not necessary at all--encyclopedic cookbooks have been serving as cyborg extensions of memory for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I don't need to know how to make pastry dough. &amp;nbsp;I wrote it here in this blog. &amp;nbsp;The blog remembers how. &amp;nbsp;To return to my question, is this worth writing, let's compare this to my diaries. &amp;nbsp;I have boxes and boxes of diaries. &amp;nbsp;Most of them I have read at least twice. &amp;nbsp;Reading them is at once familiar and surprising--on the one hand, reading them triggers memories and I might also recall writing what I wrote, on the other, I had, up until reading it, forgotten much if not all of what I wrote. &amp;nbsp;One is almost always remembering in one way or another, but there is obviously nothing cumulative about it. &amp;nbsp;Reading a diary doesn't add to a collection of things I remember, but puts me in a different stream of remembering. &amp;nbsp;Through reading the diary some memories come to life again--I think about them again briefly, they might crop up over and over for a long time. &amp;nbsp;In other words, the diary must be read, and reading happens in time. &amp;nbsp;Having "saved" (the anxiety of losing memories drove much of my diary writing) these memories in a diary, only in the unread text of the diary might they be saved. &amp;nbsp;Only without a reader might the text be said to exist as a totality. &amp;nbsp;But not really, of course--it isn't anything without being read, is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this blog is not a diary. &amp;nbsp;I'm not trying to record the ephemera of experience here. &amp;nbsp;A recipe is simply supposed to record a procedure in a way that's followable. &amp;nbsp;Actually this isn't so simple, as I've discussed &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2010/11/disappointment.html"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;And thankfully. &amp;nbsp;Wouldn't it be awfully dull if even just a recipe could be written in the universal register? &amp;nbsp;This suggests another purpose for a recipe: to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;be quite followable. &amp;nbsp;Not that a recipe writer has to try to do this, but a recipe's potential to confuse, mystify, or unintentionally inspire might be valued. &amp;nbsp;Because apparently I need to subject recipes to the literary theories of decades ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pie was good. &amp;nbsp;The crust I thought was a bit too hard, although someone else liked it, called it "crunchy." &amp;nbsp;I prebaked the crust for fifteen minutes or so before filling it, using the sweet potato pieces in tinfoil as a weight to keep the crust from puffing up. &amp;nbsp;Improvising a weight was the most enjoyable part. &amp;nbsp;Next time however I'll just fill the unbaked crust, so that the crust turns out softer.</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2010/11/sweet-potato-pie.html'

href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2010/10/tarte-tatin-iii-golden-delicious-boring.html"&gt;we discussed earlier&lt;/a&gt;, dear nonexistant readers, the ostensible purpose of a recipe is to facilitate recreations of the same result.&amp;nbsp; But of course this is not the whole story.&amp;nbsp; When you’re most in need of a recipe is when you’ve never made what the recipe tells you how to make.&amp;nbsp; At such a delicate time you take care to follow the recipe exactly.&amp;nbsp; Having never followed the recipe before, it is easy to misunderstand the recipe.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes, by sheer luck, the first time comes out flawlessly.&amp;nbsp; More often there are some kinks, which over the next few attempts, are worked out, and finally a satisfactory result is produced.&amp;nbsp; After this point, if you need the recipe at all any more, it is more as a memory map than an instruction set.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;What is it you have created?&amp;nbsp; Your creation conforms to &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2010/11/bizcochuelo-de-papa.html"&gt;the limited contours that the recipe provides&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; If you were after a replica of what the author sought to instruct you to make, however, there is no way of confirming this.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes there are photos, which often provide a more forceful impulse than the recipe itself--you see the photo and think “I want to make &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://aapplemint.com/2008/08/09/maamul/"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.”&amp;nbsp; It’s sometimes easy to make it look right, sometimes it isn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;All these masturbatory, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42G7nJb1IEI"&gt;death-of-the-chef&lt;/a&gt; preoccupations aside, whether or not the recipe changes, &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; change.&amp;nbsp; At least, this is one way of accounting for culinary disappointments.&amp;nbsp; Tonight I made pasta with tomato-cream sauce and shrimp for dinner, and I ate it, but only because I was hungry. &amp;nbsp;The flavors were weak, and the textures even a little nauseating. &amp;nbsp;I’ve made pasta with tomato-cream sauce in countless different ways, some less satisfying than others.&amp;nbsp; And I keep making some form of it because I remember a few delicious instances of this dish.&amp;nbsp; But this time it’s been long enough I wonder if I have any idea what I’m after.&amp;nbsp; If I made what to me was a wonderful pasta dish a year ago, and ate it today, would I like it much?&amp;nbsp; There really isn’t any way of finding out empirically.&amp;nbsp; If I wrote down &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2009/09/without-vodka.html"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;the precise recipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for those times when I made a particularly spectacular rendition, I doubt I would be able to reliably cook it again. &amp;nbsp;And I doubt I would want to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;A recipe is a much more intriguing beast than &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2009/10/chop-sentences-well-pour-3-qts.html"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;it may have appeared&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;The general shape inconsistently described above also applies to me writing this entry. &amp;nbsp;Through writing, what I wanted to write changed. &amp;nbsp;What I thought I was writing changed. &amp;nbsp;These changes can hardly be tracked by the writing itself to create something coherent. &amp;nbsp;To me it appears that throughout the entry I forgot what I meant to write, and began on a new, somewhat related tangent. &amp;nbsp;By the end forgot the import of everything I had just written, summing it up as "intriguing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2010/11/ate-my-soul-and-gave-me-recipe.html' title='Ate My Soul and Gave Me The

had forgotten about Olga de Trejos' &lt;i&gt;La Cocina Practica&lt;/i&gt;. This ardently mundane title resurfaced in a--no, the: I haven't done it in five years or more--thorough cleaning of my room. I think the fact that it's in Spanish, a language I more or less understand but am not very comfortable speaking has a great deal to do with my conviction that there is something to be found in this book. In it's range of recipes it is &lt;i&gt;The Joy of Cooking&lt;/i&gt;, but unlike &lt;i&gt;Joy&lt;/i&gt; it is more concerned with nutrition facts than technique, and rather than outlining recipes in painstaking specificity, de Trejos, with her exceedingly short recipes, seems to assume you know what she's talking about. Not knowing, in my case, is compounded by the fact that Spanish is not my native tongue. However most of the recipes are nonetheless very recognizable. The book seems to be for the most part (and here's the resemblance to &lt;i&gt;Joy&lt;/i&gt;) a convenient anthology of European-derived classics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I'm fascinated by a dessert I've never ever heard of: Bizcochuelo de Papa, or, in rough English translation, Potato Cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="recipe"&gt;1 libra de papas&lt;br /&gt;6 huevos&lt;br /&gt;9 cucharadas de azúcar refinado&lt;br /&gt;jugo de 1 limón y cáscara rallada&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Se hace un puré con las papas bien calientes para que quede espumoso. Se le agrega el jugo de limón, la cáscara rallada y las 6 yemas bien batidas, con el azúcar. Se baten las claras a punto de nieve y se incorporan suavemente a la mescla anterior. Se coloca en un molde engrasado, se espolvorea con azúcar refinado y se hornea a calor moderado.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TNzsRLWy-FI/AAAAAAAAClI/5je6CTd8Jkw/s1600/IMG_0185.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TNzsRLWy-FI/AAAAAAAAClI/5je6CTd8Jkw/s200/IMG_0185.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Nasty lightining isn't it?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;At first, having no idea what bizcochuelo meant, I thought it was a kind of potato pudding, because of the large quantity of eggs. The eggs are separated and the whites are beaten into frothy peaks. I like the spanish metaphor for this: one beats them "a punto de nieve"--"to the point of snow" or "into snow." The beaten egg whites, in my mind, make it a kind of angel food cake, but with potatoes. Why use potatoes in a dessert? The exotic imagination boggles.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p3"&gt;My bad English translation of the recipe:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;1 pound of potatoes&lt;br /&gt;6 eggs&lt;br /&gt;9 tablespoons sugar&lt;br /&gt;juice of 1 lemon and its zest&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make a pure with the hot potatoes so that they stay fresh (sparkling? in spanish espumoso) Mix in the lemon juice, zest and the six egg yolks, beaten well with the sugar. Beat the egg whites to high peaks and fold in the yolk-potato mixture.  Put in a greased mold and sprinkle with sugar and bake to a golden brown.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: -webkit-auto;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TNzsTBJRWUI/AAAAAAAAClM/HvrYmAt5yNk/s1600/IMG_0187.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: black;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TNzsTBJRWUI/AAAAAAAAClM/HvrYmAt5yNk/s200/IMG_0187.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Yes, you have to see three photos of potatoes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might notice there is no oven temperature, or, for that matter, baking time. Nor is any shape or size of baking mold specified. But what I really love is the way the recipe begins in the middle of the action. Never mind how the potatoes are cooked, or even if they're cooked--just puree them when they're hot, so that they remain... what? Perhaps someone could help me out with what espumoso means here?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p4"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p3"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TNzsUnjae1I/AAAAAAAAClQ/qZ4hYAFrrIc/s1600/IMG_0188.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TNzsUnjae1I/AAAAAAAAClQ/qZ4hYAFrrIc/s200/IMG_0188.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Not nearly yellow enough.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I decided to try it anyway, making the following assumptions: the potatoes would be boiled and mashed without any of the water, the baking temperature would be 350 F, and the baking pan would be whatever I had that seems about the right size to accommodate the batter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p4"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;My friend who agreed to join me in this endeavor (as in to make another version and tell me about it) commented that it seems like a lot of eggs for not very much potato. I agree, but when I began mixing it together it began to make sense: the potato paste is very dry, and the six yolks are just enough. Well, five might do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TNzsP80rsaI/AAAAAAAAClE/uYwc8om1PWs/s1600/IMG_0189.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TNzsP80rsaI/AAAAAAAAClE/uYwc8om1PWs/s1600/IMG_0189.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TNzsP80rsaI/AAAAAAAAClE/uYwc8om1PWs/s200/IMG_0189.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TNzsP80rsaI/AAAAAAAAClE/uYwc8om1PWs/s1600/IMG_0189.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; display: inline !important; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TNzsNmvLIBI/AAAAAAAACk8/6kQbcuQYv-U/s1600/IMG_0191.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; display: inline !important; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TNzsNmvLIBI/AAAAAAAACk8/6kQbcuQYv-U/s200/IMG_0191.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TNzsOqowC_I/AAAAAAAAClA/i6SmhnDqCTQ/s1600/IMG_0190.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TNzsOqowC_I/AAAAAAAAClA/i6SmhnDqCTQ/s200/IMG_0190.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;This, as well, was more yellow. &amp;nbsp;And on the right side.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TNzsMJz5C3I/AAAAAAAACk4/UTRa8Oz3pSs/s1600/IMG_0193.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/TNzsMJz5C3I/AAAAAAAACk4/UTRa8Oz3pSs/s200/IMG_0193.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p3"&gt;The result was something very nothing--pleasant and delicate. The metaphysical implications of describing it as “very nothing” are familiarly appalling, but. Why not give (or allow) it a bit of fruit and/or a glaze?

(If stupidity is doing the same thing and expecting different result, what is doing something different and expecting the same result?)&amp;nbsp; It was through this daft variation that the necessities of the recipe revealed themselves.&amp;nbsp; Pears instead of apples and honey instead of sugar are fine.&amp;nbsp; But whole wheat pastry flour makes more finicky dough than all-purpose flour, the type of apples is dramatically important where &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2010/10/tarte-tatin-ii-applesauce.html"&gt;consistency&lt;/a&gt; is concerned, and caramelization is a highly sensitive process that if you're niggly about burnt spots requires stirring, flipping, and paranoia about how long to leave the pan on high heat.&amp;nbsp; And so several seemingly unimportant details, glossed over by most recipes, become solidified into details that must happen.&amp;nbsp; If knowledge is as I have just described it, a collection of immobile things, perhaps this is why I am not at all motivated to write another recipe now that I think I know what I'm doing where this tart is concerned.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://sometimestheycook.blogspot.com/2010/10/pear-honey-tarte-tatin.html"&gt;The previous recipe&lt;/a&gt; was in pursuit, and we've all heard those sayings about how it's all in the chase.&amp;nbsp; It was a recipe of what I imagined should be done, an imaginative fiction of sorts.&amp;nbsp; This recipe that I feel I should but don't want to write would be a history.&amp;nbsp; Although I would make some minor changes: I would caramelize it for just a little longer.&amp;nbsp; I would make sure there isn't a gap in the arrangement of apple slices.&amp;nbsp; I would use a little less water in the dough (the crust was a bit tough).&amp;nbsp; I suppose the point of writing the recipe down would be as an elaborate mimetic.&amp;nbsp; Months or years from now I will have forgotten about all this, and the recipe should allow me to make the same tart again, even though without the recipe I won't remember how.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;Well, I still have one more round of dough in the fridge.&amp;nbsp; I'll write the recipe after I make one more tart.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2010/10/tarte-tatin-iii-golden-delicious-boring.html' title='Tarte Tatin III:

time&lt;/a&gt;, but with apples instead of pears.&amp;nbsp; But they were Granny Smith apples, and so the result is very thick, sweetened, somewhat caramelized applesauce on top of pastry.&amp;nbsp; It doesn't taste bad, in fact it tastes very good, but the texture is not at all what I was hoping for.&amp;nbsp; Apparently I should be using a different kind of apple, one that doesn't disintegrate when baked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other problems included a hunk of pie dough very irritable from being left in the fridge for a few days.&amp;nbsp; Like a bad case of athlete's foot, it cracked over and over when rolled out, and it fell apart being gently tucked into the pan.&amp;nbsp; Its fragility was probably in part due to the whole wheat pastry flour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some parts of the top (the bottom) were virtually charcoal, which I remedied by just scraping them off.&amp;nbsp; But maybe I should move the apples around in the pan while they're cooking in the boiling caramel.&lt;br

type='text'>Pear-Honey Tarte Tatin</title><content type='html'>Having just watched, I don't remember why, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veuXU0hiT_I"&gt;someone who is apparently not Jamie Oliver make Tarte Tatin&lt;/a&gt;, I stared at three pears waiting to rot in the fridge, and had a mad idea.&amp;nbsp; I think, in retrospect, I was more enamored with the madness than the idea itself (not that there is such a thing): make Tarte Tatin with these pears, but use honey for the caramel (there's no sugar in the house).&amp;nbsp; If this is "madness" my life must be terribly mundane.&amp;nbsp; It became apparent when I started peeling the pears that every recipe I had read used enough fruit to fill the pan completely, sometimes layering more on top.&amp;nbsp; Julia Child's pan, the extreme case, &lt;a href="http://video.pbs.org/video/1166840087/"&gt;is brimming over&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; So it would be a scant tart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a recipe I followed the "filling" part from &lt;a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/10/mollys-apple-tarte-tatin/"&gt;smitten kitchen&lt;/a&gt;'s, and (roughly) &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/goog_1289596711"&gt;&lt;span id="goog_1289596709"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beyondsalmon.com/2006/03/technique-of-week-pie-and-tart-dough.html"&gt;Helen Rennie's extremely explicit pastry technique&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span id="goog_1289596710"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; Except I halved smitten kitchen's recipe, because I was only using half the amount of fruit, I used ~1/3 cup honey instead of 1/2 cup sugar, and for the crust whole wheat pastry flour, which is not as heavy as whole wheat flour, but does taste like something and has some texture.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem, I think, with using honey is that it caramelizes more quickly than sugar.&amp;nbsp; So while smitten kitchen's recipe called for cooking the caramel with fruit for ten minutes on high heat, after five minutes I was afraid I had ruined the whole mess, and then I only cooked it for another minute or two after flipping the pear halves over.&amp;nbsp; And even then, I think it came out just a little too burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align:

/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Oops, I didn't cut the edges free from the pan before turning it out.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a

despite being maybe a little too caramelized, and not terribly pretty, it was still delicious.&amp;nbsp; I made enough dough for another, maybe next time I'll try apples--more than three, even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is the untested recipe I would follow if I were to make this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="myrecipe"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Pastry (for two tarts)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;13.5 oz (~3 cups) whole wheat pastry flour&lt;br /&gt;2 1/2 sticks butter&lt;br /&gt;1 tsp salt&lt;br /&gt;2 tsp sugar&lt;br /&gt;1 cup ice water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a postage scale, weigh a medium bowl, and then subtract this weight to weigh 13.5 oz flour in it.&amp;nbsp; Set this aside, and put the sugar and salt on top of it.&amp;nbsp; Cut the (cold) butter into lengthwise quarters and then many chunks (~1cm square).&amp;nbsp; Scatter these on a plate and put in the freezer for ten minutes.&amp;nbsp; Move the flour with salt and sugar to a food processor.&amp;nbsp; Put in the butter chunks.&amp;nbsp; Pulse repeatedly until the butter is cut into pea-size or smaller pieces.&amp;nbsp; While pulsing every second or two, slowly pour 1/2 cup ice-cold water.&amp;nbsp; Pick up some dough with your hand and squeeze it.&amp;nbsp; If it holds together easily, not falling apart after you stop squeezing, it's enough water.&amp;nbsp; If it falls apart, add more water in small increments until it does hold together.&amp;nbsp; Dump half of the not-yet-formed dough mixture out onto a flat, clean surface, scrape it together into one mass (despite the paranoia of heat that accompanies pastry dough, I think your hands are fine as a scraping instrument), and squeeze into a ball.&amp;nbsp; Do the same with the other half of the unformed dough mixture.&amp;nbsp; Seal with plastic (a bag, or plastic wrap) and refrigerate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fruit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 pears&lt;br /&gt;3/4 cup honey&lt;br /&gt;1 stick butter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preheat oven to 375 F.&amp;nbsp; Peel, halve, and core pears.&amp;nbsp; Splash a little lemon juice on top of them.&amp;nbsp; Melt butter on low heat in a large saucepan that can be put into the oven (no plastic parts).&amp;nbsp; Remove from heat, and stir in honey with a whisk.&amp;nbsp; Arrange pears facing down (they will be flipped).&amp;nbsp; Cut pear halves into pear quarters to fill in gaps.&amp;nbsp; While it's cooking, roll out pastry dough into something that will more than cover the top of the pan.&amp;nbsp; Cook on high heat for 3 or 4 minutes.&amp;nbsp; Flip pears.&amp;nbsp; Cook for another 2 minutes.&amp;nbsp; Roll the flat dough onto a rolling pin or other cylindrical object, to make transferring it onto the pan easier.&amp;nbsp; Lay it on top of the pan.&amp;nbsp; Push the edges into the sides of the pan, where possible between the pears and the sides of the pan.&amp;nbsp; Bake in the oven for about 30 minutes.&amp;nbsp; When the crust is just barely browned, take it out.&amp;nbsp; Let it cool for 30 minutes.&amp;nbsp; Unstick the edges of the crust from the sides of the pan with a knife.&amp;nbsp; Place a plate (significantly larger than the pan if possible) on top of the pan.&amp;nbsp; Using pot holders on both hands holding the pan and the plate together, quickly flip them over so that the tart falls onto the plate.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link

until it tastes strongly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is to go with rice or rice noodles, analogous to peanut sauce, I guess.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rather than cayenne pepper powder, sriracha or some other potent hot sauce would probably taste better. &amp;nbsp;I'm not so sure that coconut milk goes so well with eggplant. &amp;nbsp;Maybe some other liquid should be used to thin the sauce to the right consistency, perhaps even a little water. &amp;nbsp;After all the eggplant fried in oil is rich enough. &amp;nbsp;Next, I think, is an eggplant-cream sauce for pasta.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2010/04/eggplant-sauce-1.html'

/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Making Way for The Chosen People&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"About 60 million years ago the dinosaurs disappeared. &amp;nbsp;When they went out of the picture, the Age of Reptiles came to an end."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The habit of some dinosaurs of eating the eggs of others probably played a part in bringing an end to the dinosaurs. &amp;nbsp;The rise of a great new group of animals, the mammals, doubtless played a part, too."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"These big reptiles were truly huge. &amp;nbsp;But they were not the biggest animals that have ever lived. &amp;nbsp;No dinosaur was as big as a blue whale."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thank God for Sense&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Doubtless the reason many of the dinosaurs died is that their bodies were too big for their brains. &amp;nbsp;With smaller bodies and bigger brains they might have lived on. &amp;nbsp;They were successful for a very long time because conditions on the earth remains almost the same for millions of years. &amp;nbsp;When conditions changed, they did not have sense enough to help themselves in any way."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Resorting to Slurs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Stegosaurus has so tiny a brain that it could not control the muscles of its legs."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The head of Brontosaurus was small. &amp;nbsp;There was not much room in it for brains. &amp;nbsp;The brain of the thunder lizard weighed only about a pound--not much of a brain for a 35-ton body. &amp;nbsp;The big animal must have been stupid."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Like Brontosaurus, Diplodocus was clumsy and stupid."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;--Insects--&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;When Only the Unequivocal Will Do&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Only people and the social insects are really social."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Us &amp;amp; The Commies&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"In some ways an insect society is far ahead of a community of people. &amp;nbsp;Every individual that is old enough to work has work to do; there is no unemployment. &amp;nbsp;Every insect knows exactly how to carry on its work in the community; it does not have to be taught. &amp;nbsp;There are practically no quarrels between members of the group. &amp;nbsp;But neither is there any freedom. &amp;nbsp;We like our own societies, in spite of their faults, much better."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;--Birds (Friends &amp;amp; Enemies)--&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Am I Using My Eyes Properly?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A bird inherits its way of nest-building. &amp;nbsp;It does not have to be taught how to build a nest, just as we do not have to be taught how to use our eyes."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just In Case You Wondered...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"All birds have two legs."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"All birds have wings."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Good, The Bad, And The Cannibals&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Some birds are our friends and others are our enemies."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"On the other side of the ledger is the harm which birds do us by eating fruit, grain, and helpful insects. &amp;nbsp;Some birds harm us, moreover, by eating the eggs of other birds and even small birds themselves."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Of course, no bird is ever consciously helping us or harming us. &amp;nbsp;They are simply eating the food they are fitted for eating."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;--Snakes--&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Many people are so afraid of poisonous snakes that they kill every snake they can. &amp;nbsp;These people are being unfair to snakes in general."</content><link rel='related'

&amp;nbsp;Added a little splash of almond extract, few large pinches of cinnamon, a quarter (grated off) of a nutmeg, and a large pinch of baking powder. &amp;nbsp;Mixed in handfuls of white flour until it became a very soft dough. &amp;nbsp;Baked tablespoon sized dollops at 350 F until a little browned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What should be done is&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;to make just enough dough to hold together the almonds and currants. &amp;nbsp;This dough should be sweeter and less starchy (mostly butter, egg, and sugar). &amp;nbsp;The dough should be formed into large shallow

Articles must be dropped, but the most obvious steps must be pinned down with the utmost exactitude.  And the continuity of labels is sacred, as if I'm writing in a programming language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also, what was all the fuss about numbers as words instead of numerals?  The idea at first was to make these recipes as transparent as possible, though I sabotaged that supposed goal at every turn, writing "one" instead of "1" was just one way to do that.  The first recipe, for lentil soup, appears to be making itself as opaque as possible by making a spectacle of its potential transparency.  Really that's what I love doing anyway.  The point, apparently, is not to write accessible recipes, but to make a show of it, to be dramatic, to reveal myself hiding.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2009/10/chop-sentences-well-pour-3-qts.html' title='Chop sentences well.

This sauce is similar, but less tomatoey, and with mushrooms and pine nuts.  [And wine, though it's quite good without it.]  Recipes are generally presumed to be finished.  But I've varied this sauce so many times...  Sometimes more tomatoes, sometimes fewer, sometimes tomato sauce (though I really don't recommend tomato paste--that gives it a sickly, blunt, cardboard flavour), sometimes no mushrooms or pine nuts.  And I've tried varying the herbs a lot.  Paprika might be nice.  Hot chiles are what you would expect--and some people I'm sure would really hate the result.  Rosemary is probably a mistake.  Sage would certainly kill it.  If you have it, fresh oregano and basil really are vast improvements over themselves dried.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;1/2 onion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;1 1/3 cups heavy cream&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4 roma tomatoes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;6 crimini mushrooms&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2 cloves garlic&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4 tablespoons grated parmesan&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2 tablespoons pine nuts&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3 tablespoons olive oil&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2 tablespoons butter&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1/2 teaspoon black pepper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1 teaspoon dried oregano (or 1 tablespoon fresh leaves)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1 teaspoon dried basil (or about 10 fresh leaves)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[1/2 cup white wine]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oil a large saucepan on medium-low heat with 2 tablespoons olive oil and melt 2 tablespoons of butter in it.  Put a small saucepan on medium heat.  Chop finely onion and garlic and transfer to large saucepan.  Don't let the onions burn.  Toast pine nuts in small saucepan until well browned but hopefully not blackened.  Put pine nuts aside in a bowl.  Oil small sauce pan with 1 tablespoon olive oil and turn heat to medium-low.  Slice tomatoes into quarters and then 5mm slices and transfer to small saucepan.  Don't let the tomatoes stick to the pan.  Add a pinch of salt to both pans.  Chop mushrooms in half and then into slices and stir into large saucepan.  The goal here is to cook the onions until soft and at the same time begin reducing the tomatoes into a sauce.  Add black pepper, oregano, basil to large saucepan.  [When onions are mostly cooked, add white wine and let it boil off for a minute or two.]  Once the onions are done, transfer the tomatoes to the large saucepan.  Stir in heavy cream.  Once the cream begins to boil, adjust the heat so that it boils just gently.  Add toasted pine nuts.  Reduce sauce to an almost pudding-like consistency, occasionally stirring to keep from sticking to the bottom of the pan.  Grate in parmesan while stirring.  Salt to taste.  Remove from heat.  Serve over pasta.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2009/09/without-vodka.html' title='Without Vodka'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/3809258542490200727/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2009/09/without-vodka.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3809258542490200727'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3809258542490200727'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2009/09/without-vodka.html' title='Without Vodka'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/SsWmirbUwiI/AAAAAAAACSg/v5n1HMKqMVg/s72-c/Glass-Vodka-Bottle-W08-450-.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-1259780155586011170</id><published>2009-09-29T14:38:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:01:12.748-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Not Quite Lorraine</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/SsWqIe9czSI/AAAAAAAACSo/sijkKE61Dhc/s1600-h/2446029640_7d093f5fb7.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5387899591945145634" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/SsWqIe9czSI/AAAAAAAACSo/sijkKE61Dhc/s400/2446029640_7d093f5fb7.jpg" style="cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; float: right; height: 300px; margin: 0 0 10px 10px; width: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But quiche nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;crust, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://beyondsalmon.blogspot.com/2006/03/technique-of-week-pie-and-tart-dough.html"&gt;adapted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;one stick butter&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;one and a half cup whole wheat pastry flour&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;half teaspoon salt&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;one teaspoon sugar&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;half cup cold water or less&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Preheat oven to 400F.  Put together flour, salt, and sugar in a large bowl.  Using flour as a way to keep butter from being slippery, cut stick of butter into small cubes (~1cm square) and distribute into flour.  Cut butter into flour (in lieu of a pastry cutter, a fork will work with some finger pain).  Add cold water a tablespoon at a time until it's possible to smash the dry clumps into a ball of dough with your hands.  Sprinkle some flour liberally on a flat surface.  Use this area to roll ball of dough into a disk large enough to lay on top of your pie dish plus a couple inches.  While you're rolling dough keep it from sticking by flipping over and sprinkling more flour on each side.  Lay dough disk into pie dish and push it around to conform to the shape of the dish.  Cut off excess if you want (eat it!).  Poke the bottom of it with a fork a few times.  Bake until dry but not browned or hardened.  It will bubble when baked--this is generally a big no-no, countered by weighing down the dough with heavy objects in a bag, but you're not cooking this crust hard, so the bubbles should be pressed back down by the liquid of the filling.  Or they won't.  I'm lazy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;filling, &lt;a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Quiche-Lorraine-I/Detail.aspx"&gt;adapted&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;half an onion&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;four crimini mushrooms&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;quarter stick butter&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;one cup grated swiss cheese&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;four eggs&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;two cups heavy cream&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;one teaspoon salt&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;a pinch sugar&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;half teaspoon cayenne pepper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;half teaspoon paprika&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Preheat oven to to 425 F.  Chop onion into 1cm square pieces.  Slice mushrooms in half and then into thin slices.  Melt butter in a small frying pan and fry onions and mushrooms on medium-low heat until onions are translucent.  Remove from heat.  In a large bowl mix together thoroughly eggs, cream, salt, and sugar.  Grate cheese into crust.  Transfer onions and mushrooms into crust.  Pour egg and cream mixture on top of this.  Muss it about with a spoon to avoid a heap of cheese in the middle.  Sprinkle cayenne pepper and paprika on top.  Bake until top becomes somewhat browned.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2009/09/not-quite-lorraine.html' title='Not Quite Lorraine'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/1259780155586011170/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2009/09/not-quite-lorraine.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1259780155586011170'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/1259780155586011170'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2009/09/not-quite-lorraine.html' title='Not Quite Lorraine'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/SsWqIe9czSI/AAAAAAAACSo/sijkKE61Dhc/s72-c/2446029640_7d093f5fb7.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-3296394603205958735</id><published>2009-09-29T14:26:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:01:12.762-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mostly Inedible'/><title type='text'>Cold, Hard Proof that it's Summer (well, not so hard)</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/SsKNdiX3nuI/AAAAAAAACRw/z6prY6lL_mI/s1600-h/0929091726-00.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5387023642871176930" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/SsKNdiX3nuI/AAAAAAAACRw/z6prY6lL_mI/s400/0929091726-00.jpg" style="cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; float: right; height: 400px; margin: 0 0 10px 10px; width: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Even if it's not summer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;one bottle lemonade (make it yourself, for all I care)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;five strawberries&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2 tablespoons rose water&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[eight cloves]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Drink a small glass of lemonade.

Really, convince yourself.  Or maybe the odor of the nutmeg will unexpectedly please you.  Or maybe you don't care, and you will look at this recipe only for its proportions of water, lentils, and salt (the last of which isn't provided).

Meanwhile, chop the onion into 1cm square pieces or smaller, the garlic as finely as possible, and the chile(s) into lengthwise quarters and then fine slices.  Transfer all three into the pot and spread evenly for frying.  Make sure that the heat is low enough that it doesn't burn the onions.  Add the coriander, cumin, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Slice the tomato into quarters and then fairly thin slices.  Once the onions are translucent, soft, and somewhat sweet, add the lentils, the tomatoes, and roughly a quart of water or twice as high as the lentils in the bottom of the pot.  Turn heat to medium-high until the water boils, and then turn back down to medium-low.  Let it mildly boil until lentils expand to the top of the pot, then add more water to create your desired consistency (I like to keep at least a 1/2 inch of water above the mass of lentils).  Add salt.  Continue cooking on low heat until the lentils are soft.  You may need to add more water.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='related' href='http://postgradpancakes.blogspot.com/2009/09/lentil-soup-41358.html' title='Lentil Soup #41358'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.zoggop.com/feeds/7986250097926375560/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2009/09/lentil-soup-41358.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7986250097926375560'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/7986250097926375560'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2009/09/lentil-soup-41358.html' title='Lentil Soup #41358'/><author><name>Mira</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05502265457306601115</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2qQbvRe_8og/URplwUE4E6I/AAAAAAAAEw8/6CBoJf88MGc/s220/bunny.png'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R7eDhiZPPR4/SsKNuB_D_yI/AAAAAAAACR4/5NUASLm_Vs8/s72-c/0929091725-00.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.page-1186235037852284609</id><published>2012-10-21T22:25:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2013-08-26T17:04:14.245-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#page'/><title type='text'>Why?</title><content type='html'>“I like how you’ve gone for the ‘make a new blog for every topic’ option,” a friend of mine said. Sadly, I can no longer amuse him with a profusion of ugly blogger themes. Everything has been combined into one massive… something. Possibly something even more archaic than a blog: a personal blog. How will I cope without at least three seperate channels at all times to give me content-absence anxiety? I will replace them with categories. By God, now I can post whatever I want!

I always feel terribly guilty about going from booth to booth knowing I won&amp;#39;t buy anything and terrified they will talk to me. Somehow, though, my desire for chocolate overrides my fear. And it boosts my courage to have another terrified person going through the trenches with me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next year we should have our own booth. We can call it Ethereal Chocolates and dress in robes and shave our heads. We will invite our audience to call upon the universe to make their invisible chocolate samples manifest in the little sample cups and name them things like &amp;quot;True Bliss&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Star Stuff&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Manna from Heaven&amp;quot;.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/3793293031371932348/comments/default/8208041320916498631'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/3793293031371932348/comments/default/8208041320916498631'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/03/7th-annual-oregon-chocolate-festival.html?showComment=1299976023435#c8208041320916498631' title=''/><author><name>Shawnana</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/03/7th-annual-oregon-chocolate-festival.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-3793293031371932348' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/3793293031371932348' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-114619601'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='March 12, 2011 at 4:27 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-1272043882173583787</id><published>2011-03-12T20:57:10.809-08:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T19:41:14.462-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Shawnana?

I bet if you made it with goat cheese, and some sort of nonwheat crust, it would be tasty. If you used a cheese that flowed more when it melted instead of stringy mozzarella, and didn&amp;#39;t let it brown in the oven, it would probably be better.

Martha Stewart has a recipe for it on her website and I have often found it in random non-Portuguese cookbooks. Emeril (the Portuguese American cook) also champions it. I think it may be more well known on the East Coast, though, because their Portuguese population is more concentrated.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/6320275484186862118/comments/default/7167085752663781711'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/6320275484186862118/comments/default/7167085752663781711'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/09/arroz-doce-sweet-rice.html?showComment=1316205194068#c7167085752663781711' title=''/><author><name>Shawna Bean</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/09/arroz-doce-sweet-rice.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-6320275484186862118' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/6320275484186862118' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-114619601'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='September 16, 2011 at 1:33 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-2343002980873718698</id><published>2011-09-16T13:34:27.072-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T19:41:14.520-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Also, pancakes!

I love how so much of your blog is you taking a recipe, throwing it out the window and stumbling through something half invented with a great deal of misadventure in the process. And my god do I know what it&amp;#39;s like to be confused by a recipe! It&amp;#39;s so weird. Recipes take on this pedantic role of telling you how the cooking should be done, but so many that I&amp;#39;ve tried, if you actually take their demands to heart, completely fall apart. For example, I made shrimp yesterday and Martha Stewart insisted I cook said shrimp for two minutes until they turned pink and opaque. Well, by two minutes they were definitely not opaque. Martha, how could you have failed me?!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Either way, I applaud you for attempting a British recipe. And the results look delicious. And the caramel cause makes me want to make candy glass with you :)</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/8629876085673936327/comments/default/2528753938857501691'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/8629876085673936327/comments/default/2528753938857501691'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/10/8-oz-stale-bread-bread-pudding-with.html?showComment=1317881989008#c2528753938857501691' title=''/><author><name>A Cat</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://www.zoggop.com/2011/10/8-oz-stale-bread-bread-pudding-with.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8629876085673936327' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8629876085673936327' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-114619601'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='October 5, 2011 at 11:19 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-4089328694295412133</id><published>2011-10-10T10:10:35.366-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T19:41:14.535-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>You know what would be really cool?

We talk about food, before and after eating. We share experiences of food with each other. We discover each others&amp;#39; dirty food secrets -- like how we sometimes try to stave off *swallowing* fantastic food just to taste it those few perfect seconds more. While eating great food, we often moan and find our toes curl. While eating overpriced, ordinary food we sneer in disdain and talk through the mush. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To describe food like an art critic is bullshit, perhaps. But to say &amp;quot;FUCK YEAH BABY BRING DAT PALM SUGAR AWWW YEAHHHH&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Is that fuckin thyme in the vodka!?&amp;quot; is for me an attempt to connect and share at a completely earthy yet ethereal plane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I still have the photograph of you drinking filter coffee that winter night when I took you to Saravana Bhavan. Didn&amp;#39;t tell you how beautiful you looked, how lost you were in that moment. The futile yet mandatory attempt to recapture that moment, those moments, those motes.... that is the purpose of talking about food.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/8109507497119653484/comments/default/7299272821344150154'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/8109507497119653484/comments/default/7299272821344150154'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/08/foodies.html?showComment=1346221766638#c7299272821344150154' title=''/><author><name>Aniruddha Shankar</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11887990059098712114</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://www.zoggop.com/2012/08/foodies.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-8109507497119653484' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1033908084137713642/posts/default/8109507497119653484' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-114619601'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='August 28, 2012 at 11:29 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1033908084137713642.post-3383376373528316648</id><published>2012-08-29T11:11:51.087-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T19:41:14.576-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Yeah, maybe I&amp;#39;m not talking about foodies in t...</title><content type='html'>Yeah, maybe I&amp;#39;m not talking about foodies in this post, but another species of food-obsessed. Their mind/body problem clearly doesn&amp;#39;t apply to you and yours (although there is an aesthetic--bad food is overpriced, it seems). I think I&amp;#39;m a bit frightened by the lively eros of the lifestyle you describe. I speak of allowing the body to speak, but for me when it&amp;#39;s not quiet it&amp;#39;s queasy. Call me unsexy, but my moments of &amp;quot;FUCK YEAH BABY&amp;quot; are short, and I wonder if they were ever more than a memory. Deliberately savoring them leads only to the unpleasant sensation of reaching for the past. (To one manifesto another, it appears--look how defensive I&amp;#39;ve gotten. But maybe this is a good if obscure place to describe this blog.) Here I mostly record my experiments to find what I can live with, rather than what thrills me.
