</h2>
<p>Nonetheless, she has a lot in common with those imfamous "millenials." Having once lived without want, she is plopped into life with only knowing how to be well-off. She flails, talks to people who aren't there (though everyone present says she talks to herself), she drinks, she comes up with needlessly convoluted, protracted paths to the good life (she'll go to computer school so she can study interior design <em>online</em>). The difference between her and someone in their 20's is, the only way out she can imagine is marriage.</p>

<p>Comedic judgement falls on the rich and the (aesthetically) poor equally, but never in between.</p>

<p>I guess we're supposed to laugh at her cynicism as she strings a wealthy man into marrying her. I'm sad that her plans fell through. When the linen-jacket-wearing man calls off the marriage, I'm pissed. He thought he was in love!</p>

<p>If only she could've engineered it a bit better. Jasmine is such a bad actress, and Cate Blanchett is all the more impressive for it. She is in marvellous control of Jasmine coming apart. As Dorothy Parker tended to let her intellegence slip into her fictional cathexes of self-loathing, Blanchett's judgemental glare is a relief from its objects.</p>

<p>An auteur's problem is there are so many ways for the film to get away from you. An audience's pleasure is that actors are not scripts.</p>

</h2>
<p>I boil the apples <em>in</em> the sugar and butter. The peaches I throw on top of the caramel once it's done. They crackle and hiss like my fingers those times I accidentally grab hold of the skillet's handle without an oven mitt. My fear is if I cook the peaches like the apples, the peaches would release so much water that by the time they caramelized, they would become a sticky, undifferenciated goo. I suppose there's nothing wrong with jam.</p>

<p>Two days later, the peach cake tastes like mildew. Normally, the whole thing gets eaten within twenty-four hours. This last 1/3 of the cake two mornings later is like stumbling on hidden treasure. I congratulate myself for my restraint, before I take a bite. It wasn't really restraint, anyway--I just didn't eat much cake. My apetite for it dimmed after I pulled it out of the oven.</p>

<p>My friend is trying to stay away from gluten--"I've become one of those people"--but still has a mania for baking gluteny things. If anything, she bakes more when she doesn't eat the products. Dozens and dozens of cupcakes. "I like baking."</p>

<p>My father made turkey soup. "What should go in there? Potatoes, carrots, peppers, tomatoes, sour cream, cabbage?"</p>

<p>"Mostly I just like the broth."</p>

<p>Now there's a massive pot of soup in the fridge, shiny and cold. I just stare at it.</p>

<p>My brother has developed a tamarind habit, which is another way of saying he bought some blocks of tamarind mass. "Mass" and not "paste" because you have to soak it in hot water, mash it with your fingers, and then strain out the husks and seeds. Maybe if it were at home I would never bother to make tamarind water (tamarind, water, sugar), but over at his house I love squishing the debris-filled muck. It's like playing in mud--something adults have generally decided they're above. Scatological comparisons are obvious, but, obviously, unwelcome if spoken.</p>

<p>I make it concentrated, so that it can be diluted to taste, like Russian tea. My brother's girlfriend likes it very dilute--"refreshing." He likes it fairly concentrated. I can't decide. Dilute, I drink glass after glass, because every swallow is unsatisfactory. Concentrated, I drink half a glass and leave it on the table. Its cloudy solids settle to the bottom. You'd think there would be a happy medium, but I haven't found it.</p>

<p>There are those things that I repeatedly vow never to eat again, like eggs on toast. Then I look in the fridge in the morning, and think what else am I going to make? There they are, greasy as ever. It would be reasonable to conclude that eggs on toast are, like anything else, something to have sometimes. But I only seem able to think in always and never.</p>

<a href='kurt_wallander_exists_to_be_fucked_with.html'>Kurt Wallander Exists to be Fucked With</a>
</h2>
<p>Because "is it on Netflix?" is the first question one asks about a show, I began watching the second series of the Swedish <em>Wallander</em> first. A man detective--where's the fun in that? It is at least an unabashedly political political murder mystery: In the first episode, it turns out the terrorist/murderer is a military man trying to convince the government that terrorism is a threat only the military can deal with. The show also isn't entirely on Wallander's side. It's a familiar hard-boiled bargain: he can have his moments of knowingness only if he's thrown off-balance.</p>

<p>To this end, enter two women to confuse him: a new boss who he falls in love with, and a new officer who accuses him of running a boys club of an investigation.</p>

<p>"You just don't want any women on your team, right?"</p>

<p>"Maybe..."</p>

<p>That's what he is: a walking maybe. How else does one solve murder? She ends up putting together much of the case, but both women tend to get lost in the background. They come, they give Kurt presumable inner turmoil, they leave. (His boss even lives tantalizingly next door, so that he can have a crisis every time he walks his dog.) Thus problematized, he goes forth to dominate the screen. The most satisfying moment for me was cutting back and forth between a pedophile staring at a group of children playing, and Kurt at his neighbor/boss/crush. Both are uncomfortably close to their desire; the pedophile's route home from his therapist passes by a playground.</p>

<p>Nothing populates such cramped psychological quarters as family, which is one reason the first series is better. It begins with his daughter, Linda, graduating the police academy. His very first scene undermines his fatherly authority. He's on the phone with Linda's mother, who is very amused with herself (how could you not be, when he's so serious?), poking fun at him as he packs to go to Linda's graduation the next day.</p>

<p>"Isn't it today?"</p>

<p>"You're drunk."</p>

<p>"No more drunk than you are. I can see you with a glass of whiskey in your hand..."</p>

<p>So can we. As the episode goes on, he seems drunker and drunker, though he isn't necessarily drinking. The graduation <em>was</em> the day Linda's mother thought it was, as he finds out the next day, when Linda shows up at the station in uniform. She is, of course, pissed that he didn't show up.</p>

<p>"But it was a misunderstanding..!"</p>

<p>Unlike series two, in which it's Kurt supported by a host of characters, here the story is told in tandem: Kurt and Linda follow related but different trails. She has a life outside of police work. They fight, and their fights are thematically tangled up with the rest of the show.</p>

<p>Eventually, she seems to tentatively forgive him for missing her graduation, kissing him on the cheek. Over the course of an episode thick with daughter-father drama, I find that hers is just the right perspective on him. He's pompus, and abstracted, and dense, yet can be endearing. It's a critical gaze that has a consequence of humanizing him. His limits are clear.</p>

<p>It's so satisfying when she gets at an aspect of his demeanor that in the second series passes for stoical respect: "Look at you! You just stand there, blank-faced like a cold fish!"</p>

<p>Compare this anger toward the father's flaws to the downright scary relationship between daughter and father in <em>Alias</em>. There, Sydney vacillates between near-religious love of him and the realization that he is her mortal enemy. Perhaps this has the ring of psychoanalytic truth, and it's convenient for a spy show whose basic move is the 180-degree reorientation of reality. (<em>Wallander</em> is more concerned with revealing ugly prejudices through false moves.) The trouble is, Sydney's father always reserves the possibility of turning again. He's unknowable, irreducibly above.</p>

<p>Why is there no Linda in series two? Because the actress, Johanna Sällström, comitted suicide. Cue a million blog posts reading her depression into every facial tic of her performance. I can't deny that I'm fascinated, but all I can really say is, one side effect of her death is we're left with a father run amok.</p>
