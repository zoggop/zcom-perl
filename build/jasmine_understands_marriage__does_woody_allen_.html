</h2>
<p>Nonetheless, she has a lot in common with those imfamous "millenials." Having once lived without want, she is plopped into life with only knowing how to be well-off. She flails, talks to people who aren't there (though everyone present says she talks to herself), she drinks, she comes up with needlessly convoluted, protracted paths to the good life (she'll go to computer school so she can study interior design <em>online</em>). The difference between her and someone in their 20's is, the only way out she can imagine is marriage.</p>

<p>Comedic judgement falls on the rich and the (aesthetically) poor equally, but never in between.</p>

<p>I guess we're supposed to laugh at her cynicism as she strings a wealthy man into marrying her. I'm sad that her plans fell through. When the linen-jacket-wearing man calls off the marriage, I'm pissed. He thought he was in love!</p>

<p>If only she could've engineered it a bit better. Jasmine is such a bad actress, and Cate Blanchett is all the more impressive for it. She is in marvellous control of Jasmine coming apart. As Dorothy Parker tended to let her intellegence slip into her fictional cathexes of self-loathing, Blanchett's judgemental glare is a relief from its objects.</p>

<p>An auteur's problem is there are so many ways for the film to get away from you. An audience's pleasure is that actors are not scripts.</p>
