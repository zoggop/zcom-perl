# Tattoos
## 1 July 2013 9:12 PM

The fake concern I always hear from the untattooed is permanence. The nightmare scenario is some youthful, fleeting aspect preserved forever on the body. The implied corollary is that one should only permanently mark oneself with that which is permanent in oneself.

This is different from _Spider Lilies_' concern with true tattoos, which do not have to be selfsame with their bearer, but rather must do some substantial work on her. Takeko is an artful cyberneticist, seeking not to bolster the self by risking it, but to create something new and true by augmentative artifice.

The fear I speak of, on the other hand, issues from the idea of a self before and outside of marks, best preserved by remaining unmarked by anything alien to it. This self is inside, and is degraded if it does not show itself outside.

I may not be the person to say anything about tattoos: My view is not tempered by me being its object.

If it seems strange that my attention is drawn to tattoos, it cannot help but be. There are a lot of tattoos in southeast Portland. Half-concealed under pointedly casual clothing, their presence seems far more important than their artistry or import. This is of course in part because I don't pay all that much attention to their shapes and colors. Nonetheless, especially considering how the tattooed flock together (can this be called a mural?), tattoos for this crowd seems more a practice of selfhood, a lifestyle, its philosophy the opposite of those who worry about being stuck with an unworthy tattoo. That philosophy, it must be said, is basically YOLO. The self is thought to intensify by marking it with whims. Life is not wasted in pursuing desires that won't last. That, and only that, is properly life.

Both attitudes are two sides of the same sociological coin. One seeks to distance itself from the perceived markers of the lower class, indeed, to adopt distance as its overarching style. A strategy to give the impression of commanding eternity. The other--my millennial peers of Belmont and Hawthorne--frenzies to consume experiences below their means. Destabilization must be sought out because it can never be found, because it is never sought earnestly. One may pickle in cheap beer, cigarettes, cover oneself in tattoos decided upon at three in the morning. One will not be relieved of oneself.

Predictably, all I can really think when I see a tattoo is how fragile its medium. What difference, good or bad, lively or destructive, does loading that canvas with signs make? In the university library in Ashland there's a painting entitled "Marks Not Knowing Why." I do not know why it should have been painted, nor do I know why it should not.

Of course this position of mine is ridiculous, and far too neat. There. Did you see that? It bloats when it strikes itself.
