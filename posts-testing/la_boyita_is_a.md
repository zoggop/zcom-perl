# La Boyita is a 
## 11 September 2013 2:34 AM

La Boyita is a good bilingual pun. Partly because--besides a kind of camping trailer--who is the boyita? Jorgelina, who is disgusted by textbook female anatomy, and uses the bidet for hours at a time because "I'd rather grow moss than hair"? Or the young, awkward gaucho, Mario? What to say about Mario, when the film is concerned with the ethics of biological speech (or anything else as self-satisfied with its explicitness). On the one hand, Mario's parents' wilfull deafness to his anatomy means he has a lot he has to work to conceal. On the other hand, Jorgelina's father is a doctor, and in an attempt to be helpful he spews medical distinctions. She covers her ears and hums. The film tunes itself to her ears, and gives us this hum. What is it? A friendship? A romance? Her older sister wants to know. About "what went on at the farm." She wants it pinned as one kind of conquest or another. "Why are you being so mysterious? You know you're going to tell me all about it later." Jorgelina's long, tranquil silence concludes the summer.
