# Li Mu Bai is 
## 18 September 2013 4:33 PM

Li Mu Bai is so judgemental. Of a super-secret martial arts manual, he says she "misunderstands" it.

shu lien's first look at jen: an otherwise unaccountable lingering, surprise, pleasure

"its sheath is so beautiful."
"beautiful and yet dangerous. once you've seen it tainted with blood and you'll think otherwise."
(a confusion between sheath and sword, in which the *sheath* gets blood on it)

"i too like that freedom of which you speak, but i have never known it." (shu lien speaking of the tragedy that gave her to herodom--or something else?)

shu lien does not reveal to li mu bai that she fought with the thief that night.

it was jade fox who brougt about shu lien's life; jade fox killed her husband. jade fox says li mu bai's master had to die because "he underestimated us women" and "wouldn't even teach us after we had slept with him"

jade fox "stole the top secrets of wudang" but has "only mastered basic moves" lol lol

"you've misunderstood the wudang manual quite a bit" li mu bai
jen chuckles

"there is still good in you" li mu bai

jen: "wudang is a whorehouse!" ha

"you would not be in this if you hadn't stolen the sword" jade

she learned it all from readinng (jen) with "no one to guide me"

lo and jen's relationship has an antagonism alien to the aliiance of marriage

shu lien looks uncertain about this "sense of peace" li mu bai feels with her

"just here to set me up!" (with lo)

lo makes the wish? then weeps?
